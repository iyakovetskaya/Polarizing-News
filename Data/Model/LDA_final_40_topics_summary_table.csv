 as a somewhat sweeping class, it contains a number of stories that by themselves could take up a semester’s worth of wrangling. one is about the strange condition of american conservatism, in which two crises, one normal and one existential, are happening at once. 
 the normal crisis is a party crisis, the sort that afflicts all political coalitions. the republican party 40 years ago coalesced around a set of appeals that enabled its leaders to win large presidential majorities and set the national agenda. at a certain point the issue landscape changed, so did the country’s demographics, and the g.o.p. has struggled to adapt — cycling through compassionate conservatism, tea party conservatism and trumpist populism without reproducing ronald reagan’s success. 
 seen from this vantage point, the republican party’s current craziness comes from being in an extended, groundhog day version of the democratic party’s 1980s situation, in which the party’s rebuilds keep failing, but our era’s greater partisan polarization still keeps the right electorally competitive. in which case you can imagine, eventually, a potentially normal resolution, in which republicans adapt and win real popular majorities again, or fail and diminish into true minority status until their craziness abates. 
 but beneath this party crisis there is the deeper one, having to do with what conservatism under a liberal order exists to actually conserve. 
 one powerful answer is that conservatism-under-liberalism should defend human goods that are threatened by liberal ideas taken to extremes. the family, when liberal freedom becomes a corrosive hyper-individualism. traditional religion, when liberal toleration becomes a militant and superstitious secularism. local community and local knowledge, against expert certainty and bureaucratic centralization. artistic and intellectual greatness, when democratic taste turns philistine or liberal intellectuals become apparatchiks. the individual talent of the entrepreneur or businessman, against the leveling impulses of egalitarianism and the stultifying power of monopoly. 
 needless to say the right hasn’t always fought these battles well or wisely. but the fights have given conservatives a clear stake in the liberal order, a reason to be invested in its institutions and controversies even if, on occasion, they might doubt that some of its premises are true. 
 so the question, then, is what happens when the reasons for that investment weaken, when the things the right imagines itself conserving seem to slip away? 
 what does it mean to conserve the family in an era when not just the two-parent household but childbearing and sex itself are in eclipse? what does it mean to defend traditional religion in a country where institutional faith is either bunkered or rapidly declining? how do you defend localism when the internet seems to nationalize every political and cultural debate? what does the conservation of the west’s humanistic traditions mean when pop repetition rules the culture, and the great universities are increasingly hostile to even the democratic-voting sort of cultural conservative? 
 at least you can still defend the heroic entrepreneur, say the libertarians — except that the last great surge of business creativity swiftly congealed into the stultifying monopolies of silicon valley, which are leading the general corporate turn against cultural and religious forms of conservatism as well. 
 this set of problems explains the mix of radicalism, factionalism, ferment and performance art that characterizes the contemporary right. what are we actually conserving anymore? is the question, and the answers range from the antiquarian (the electoral college!) to the toxic (a white-identitarian conception of america) to the crudely partisan (the right to gerrymander) to the most basic and satisfying: whatever the libs are against, we’re for. 
 on the center and the liberal center-right, meanwhile, there’s a sense that the way out of this mess is for decent conservatives to recommit to the liberal order — “to organize and draw a bright line between themselves and the illiberals on their own side,” as my colleague david brooks put it this week. 
 but that might not be enough. in the end, conservatives need to believe the things they love can flourish within the liberal order, and it isn’t irrational to turn reactionary if things you thought you were conserving fall away. 
 so the question for the right isn’t one of commitment, but capacity. can conservative energies be turned away from fratricide and lib-baiting and used to rebuild the structures and institutions and habits whose decline has pushed the right toward crisis? and will liberal institutions, in their increasingly ideological form, allow or encourage that to happen, or stand permanently in its way? 
 in prior columns i’ve stressed how the weakness of conservatism makes it hard to imagine a successful right-wing insurrection or coup against the liberal order. 
 but weakness has rippling consequences too, and a conservatism defined by despair and disillusionment could remain central to liberalism’s crises for many years to come.

 learning social skills can be difficult if you weren’t exposed to traditional group dynamics as a child, if you struggle with a mental illness like anxiety or depression, or even if you just didn’t have a lot of positive role models when you were growing up. young people tend to learn how to manage their own emotions, recognize those of other people and manage them both effectively by socializing. if these weren’t skills you developed growing up, don’t worry. you’re not alone. 
 before we get to specific social situations, we should discuss the concept of emotional intelligence (or e.i.). put very simply, e.i. is your ability to acknowledge your own emotions, recognize emotions in others and use that information to guide your behavior. this is a relatively new area of study in the field of psychology, and developing your own e.i. can help you understand and improve your social interactions. 
 there are several models of emotional intelligence, but for our purposes, we’ll look at the author daniel goleman. he outlines five general categories of e.i. that complement and support one another. 
 self-awareness: this simply means being able to identify your own emotions and how they work. are you anxious in loud environments? do you get angry when people talk over you? if you know these things about yourself, then you’re practicing self-awareness. this can be more difficult than it sounds, but simply being aware of yourself is all it takes for this step. 
 self-regulation: taking it a step further, self-regulation deals with your ability not just to know your emotions, but manage them. sometimes that might mean handling them as they come up. if you get angry, knowing how to calm yourself down is important. however, it can also deal with managing the emotions you will face. if you know that stalking your ex’s facebook is just going to make you feel bad, self-regulation would help you go do something to better your own life instead. 
 motivation: external factors like money, status, or pain are powerful motivators. but in goleman’s model, internal motivation is a key component. this means that you know how to manage your own motivation and create or continue projects because you choose to, not because something outside yourself demands it. 
 empathy: it’s just as important to be aware of the emotions of others. this might mean developing the skills to recognize how people are expressing themselves — can you tell the difference between someone who’s comfortable versus someone who’s anxious? — but it also means understanding how other people may respond to the circumstances they’re in. 
 socialization: this area deals with your ability to steer your relationships and navigate social situations. it doesn’t mean controlling others, but understanding how to get where you want to be with other people. that might mean conveying your ideas to co-workers, managing a team, or dealing with a conflict in a relationship. 
 every social situation is different and there isn’t always a “correct” way to handle any of them. however, when viewed through the lens of these core competencies, most social situations become a lot more manageable. we’ll go over some common scenarios even adults might struggle with, but keep in mind how these principles can apply in all situations.

 confronting someone when you have a problem with that person can be scary. if you’re the type to avoid conflict, you might rationalize it away by saying you want to keep the peace, or you don’t want to upset anyone. however, this can be a way of avoiding your own feelings. if there wasn’t something bothering you, there would be nothing to confront anyone about. 
 dr. ryan howes, a clinical psychologist, explained to psychology today that it’s our own fears that keep us from confronting others. our fear that we’ll lose something we have, that we’ll hurt someone we care about, or that it will hurt but accomplish nothing. one of the first steps to constructively confronting someone is to recognize that fear in yourself and identify the real issues that led to the conflict in the first place. if you’re annoyed that your partner forgot your birthday, for example, ignoring how you feel about it won’t resolve the conflict. 
 once you’re ready, gregg walker, a professor at oregon state university, recommends having the conversation when there’s time to discuss the issue, focusing on “i” statements like “i feel hurt that we didn’t do anything for my birthday,” and describing behavior and your reaction to it, rather than hurling accusations. healthy confrontations require a fair amount of awareness of your own emotions, so this is a good time to practice that skill. 
 whether it’s a meeting or a party, any time you get more than a couple of people together in a group, it can become difficult (if not impossible) to get a word in edgewise. while most tricks on how to combat this involve managing how you talk — pausing in the middle of a sentence rather than the end, or finishing your sentence even if someone tries to interrupt — an often overlooked issue is managing how you react to being talked over. 
 it would be great if everyone was polite and let you finish or paused to ask what you’re thinking. this doesn’t always happen. if someone interrupts you and you become annoyed, that can kill your motivation to speak up again. or you might become visibly agitated and demand to be heard, which can be off putting and make people less likely to want to listen to what you have to say. 
 instead, chris macleod, counselor and author of “the social skills guidebook,” suggests accepting that group conversations are a “vortex of noise and chaos” and going with the flow. don’t spend all your time trying to fit in that one thing you badly wanted to say. instead, go with the flow of the conversation and look for new opportunities to jump in. when you do, speak loudly and with confidence. more practical tricks like keeping your stories short or framing a complaint as a story can smooth over the experience, but regulating your own frustration and annoyance is the foundation these tricks build on. 
 when you’re young, making friends can be relatively easy. school often means that there’s a group of people you’re required to hang out with who are your age. you may share some interests, and you’ll see one another almost every day. as an adult, it can be harder. everyone’s busy, everyone’s tired, and time feels in short supply. or so it seems. what really may be lacking is motivation. 
 as vox explains, one of the most important keys to developing a new friendship is, well, showing up. you both say, “we should hang out sometime!” but for some reason you never do. why? sure, you have things going on, but you still managed to binge watch the latest “stranger things.” there’s nothing wrong with a little “me” time, but it’s also o.k. to spend some of it reaching out to someone new. 
 when making new friends, you have to start with some internal motivation. decide for yourself that you’re going to make friends and then put yourself in situations where that can happen. take a class, join a club, or just talk to people you know but aren’t friends with yet. more important, follow up. if you find someone you want to be friends with — and especially if there are indications that person wants to be friends with you, too — put it on the very top of your to-do list to follow up. you’ll be surprised how easy it is when you do it on purpose. 
 talking to a stranger for the first time — whether it’s at a party, a work event, or just on the street — can be complicated. you never know less about someone than when you first meet them. that’s also something you can use to your advantage. people like to talk about themselves. so much so that, according to research from harvard university, people will sometimes even give up money to be able to talk about themselves. 
 you might feel awkward or uncomfortable when you’re out on your own, but practicing a little empathy can reveal a powerful truth: so does everyone else. research from the university of chicago found that less than 47 percent of its participants believed a stranger would be willing to talk with them. in reality, every attempt was successful. most of us are willing to have a conversation, we just don’t always want to be the one to make the first move. 
 however, not everyone is open to a conversation with strangers all the time. an easy way to check is to pay attention to what they’re doing at the time. are they wearing headphones? do they seem in a hurry? are they at their job and only making conversation as part of their duties? if so, you might try again later (or with someone else). if they’re not busy, start by saying hello or opening with a compliment. from there you can keep the conversation going with the “insight and question” method. simply offer an observation or insight, follow it up with a question, and let the conversation flow naturally. 
 these are far from the only social situations you might find yourself struggling with, but the principles that can be applied are nearly universal. acknowledge your own emotional state and manage your needs and feelings in a constructive way. take the initiative to pursue the social outcomes you want, and empathize with others who are dealing with the same struggles you are. with practice, the rest of the complex nuances of social interaction will flow a lot more naturally.",1751
15.0,0.04917203541748443,0.8026000261306763,"virus, coronavirus, health, test, case, pandemic, covid, death, spread, infection","the united states’ leading authority on infectious disease expressed hope in april that no more than 60,000 people in the country would die from the coronavirus. a revered research center predicted a few weeks later that the figure would be just over 70,000 people by early august. when the number of deaths shot up in may, president trump said that anywhere between 75,000 and 100,000 people could die. 
 on wednesday, the nation’s death toll surpassed 150,000. 
 that the figure, based on a new york times database, has soared so soon and so far beyond those estimates illustrates how difficult it can be to accurately forecast the spread of the virus, or the way citizens and politicians will respond to it. 
 “the aspect which is really impossible to predict is human behavior,” said virginia pitzer, a professor of epidemiology at yale. “to what extent are people going to socially distance themselves? to what extent are politics going to influence whether you wear a mask? all of these factors are impossible to factor in.” 
 americans have rarely been as hungry for scientific predictions as they have been this year. charts of virus case counts fill social media feeds; epidemiologists are all over television; dr. anthony s. fauci has become a household name. 
 but the statistical modelers who were trying to predict the spread of a new virus began with very little solid data, experts said, so it was no surprise that they have had to repeatedly revise their projections. the revisions have generally been in one direction: up. 
 as of wednesday evening, at least 150,909 people were known to have died of the virus in the united states, out of more than 4.4 million reported infections. and even these figures are likely to be undercounts, experts say. 
 the centers for disease control and prevention estimate that in some regions the number of people who have been infected could be two to 13 times higher than the tallies of reported cases. experts have said the official death toll probably omits many people whose deaths were virus-related, especially early in the pandemic. and more people will die each day as long as the virus continues to spread. 
 weekly averages of reported deaths in the united states had fallen substantially since an early peak in mid-april, when the national death toll was driven largely by a catastrophic surge in new york state. but deaths began to climb again this month, and the nation is now reporting about 1,000 deaths a day. 
 the current toll is being felt much more widely across many states, especially in the south, while new york is down to reporting an average of 16 deaths a day. nearly 2,200 deaths have been reported in the past week in texas, the state with the highest recent death toll relative to its population, followed by arizona and south carolina. florida broke its daily record again on wednesday, reporting 216 fatalities and bringing the state’s overall total to 6,332. 
 “the mortality is going to march in lockstep with our transmission,” said dr. sarah fortune, the chair of immunology and infectious diseases at the t.h. chan school of public health at harvard. 
 exactly what percentage of people who get the virus die from it is not yet clear. the world health organization’s chief scientist, dr. soumya swaminathan, said last month that it was likely to be about 0.6 percent. if that rate proves accurate, it would mean a vast majority of infections in the united states have gone unreported. 
 dr. fortune estimated that a mortality rate of 0.5 percent of all coronavirus cases would be a “best-case scenario,” but that the death rate could range up to 2 percent of cases, depending on how much the virus reaches into the highest-risk environments, like nursing homes. 
 “we have to do better in terms of limiting transmission,” dr. fortune said. “we have this terrible death toll because we have done a lousy job at limiting transmission.” 
 how well americans will adhere to measures meant to limit the spread of the virus has been one of the hardest things to predict, experts said, and may be partially to blame for the underestimates. 
 dr. fauci and dr. deborah l. birx, the trump administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, estimated in march that the virus could kill between 100,000 and 240,000 people in the united states, even with preventive measures. in early april, dr. fauci said on the “today” show that he thought deaths may never reach 100,000. 
 “models are really only as good as the assumptions that you put into the model, but when you start to see real data, you can modify that model, and the real data are telling us that it is highly likely that we’re having a definite positive effect,” dr. fauci said on the show, later adding: “it looks more like the 60,000 than the 100,000 to 200,000. but having said that, we’d better be careful that we don’t say, ‘ok, we’re doing so well, we can pull back.’” 
 by may 1, several states were reopening gyms, salons, restaurants and other businesses. mr. trump, who has given a wide range of predictions for the ultimate death count, said on may 3 that the virus might end up killing 100,000 people, after saying for much of april that the virus would not kill more than 75,000. 
 the next day, the institute for health metrics and evaluation, whose model is closely watched by the white house, increased its own projection, warning that there would likely be about 135,000 deaths by early august. the institute’s model, which includes a wide range of possible scenarios, now projects about 220,000 deaths by november. 
 adding to the difficulty of predicting human behavior, professor pitzer said, is that public policy can be influenced by the models: seeing a forecast may prompt officials to take actions that make the forecast less likely to come true. 
 “models are useful for playing out scenarios, but they’re not really meant to be accurate in generating long-term predictions,” she said. “they can be good at short-term forecasting — what might happen in the next couple of weeks. but longer term, knowing exactly what the trajectory of the epidemic will be —  there are just too many variables.”

 harold bloom, the prodigious literary critic who championed and defended the western canon in an outpouring of influential books that appeared not only on college syllabuses but also — unusual for an academic — on best-seller lists, died on monday at a hospital in new haven. he was 89.  
 his death was confirmed by his wife, jeanne bloom, who said he taught his last class at yale university on thursday. 
 professor bloom was frequently called the most notorious literary critic in america. from a vaunted perch at yale, he flew in the face of almost every trend in the literary criticism of his day. chiefly he argued for the literary superiority of the western giants like shakespeare, chaucer and kafka — all of them white and male, his own critics pointed out — over writers favored by what he called “the school of resentment,” by which he meant multiculturalists, feminists, marxists, neoconservatives and others whom he saw as betraying literature’s essential purpose. 
 “he is, by any reckoning, one of the most stimulating literary presences of the last half-century — and the most protean,” sam tanenhaus wrote in 2011 in the new york times book review, of which he was the editor at the time, “a singular breed of scholar-teacher-critic-prose-poet-pamphleteer.” 
 at the heart of professor bloom’s writing was a passionate love of literature and a relish for its heroic figures. 
 “shakespeare is god,” he declared, and shakespeare’s characters, he said, are as real as people and have shaped western perceptions of what it is to be human — a view he propounded in the acclaimed “shakespeare: the invention of the human” (1998).  
 the analogy to divinity worked both ways: in “the book of j” (1990), professor bloom challenged most existing biblical scholarship by suggesting that even the judeo-christian god was a literary character — invented by a woman, no less, who may have lived in the court of king solomon and who wrote sections of the first five books of the old testament. “the book of j” became a best seller.  
 professor bloom was widely regarded as the most popular literary critic in america (an encomium he might have considered faint praise). among his other best sellers were his magnum opus “the western canon: the books and school of the ages,” published in 1994, and “how to read and why” (2000).  
 that record of commercial success led many in the academy to dismiss him as a populist. “mention the name of harold bloom to academics in literature departments these days and they will roll their eyes,” the british scholar and author jonathan bate wrote in the new republic in 2011. 
 the bronx-born son of a garment worker, professor bloom might have been a character out of literature himself. with his untidy gray hair and melancholy eyes encircled by shadows, he was known to hold forth from what his students called the chair, which he, of ample girth, amply filled, surrounded by stacks of books. 
 he was fond of endearments, like “little child.” he addressed both male and female students as “dear” and would kiss them on the top of the head. 
 professor bloom called himself “a monster” of reading; he said he could read, and absorb, a 400-page book in an hour. his friend richard bernstein, a professor of philosophy at the new school, told a reporter that watching professor bloom read was “scary.” 
 armed with a photographic memory, professor bloom could recite acres of poetry by heart — by his account, the whole of shakespeare, milton’s “paradise lost,” all of william blake, the hebraic bible and edmund spenser’s monumental “the faerie queene.” he relished epigraphs, gnomic remarks and unusual words: kenosis (emptying), tessera (completing), askesis (diminishing) and clinamen (swerving). 
 he quite enjoyed being likened to samuel johnson, the great 18th-century critic, essayist, lexicographer and man about london, who, like professor bloom (“a yiddisher dr. johnson” was one appellation), was rotund, erudite and often caustic in his opinions. (professor bloom even had a vaguely english accent, his bronx roots notwithstanding.)  
 or if not johnson, then the actor zero mostel, whom he resembled. 
 “i am zero mostel!” professor bloom once said. 
 like dr. johnson’s, his output was vast: more than 40 books of his own authorship and hundreds of volumes he edited. and he remained prolific to the end, publishing two books in 2017, two in 2018 and two this year: “macbeth: a dagger of the mind” and “possessed by memory: the inward light of criticism.” his final book is to be released on an unspecified date by yale university press, his wife said.  
 perhaps professor bloom’s most influential work was one that discussed literary influence itself. the book, “the anxiety of influence,” published in 1973 and eventually in some 45 languages, borrows from freudian theory in envisioning literary creation as an epochal, and oedipal, struggle in which the young artist rebels against preceding traditions, seeking that burst of originality that distinguishes greatness. 
 professor bloom argued that a poem was both a response to another poem and a defense against it. poetry, he wrote, was a dark battleground where poets deliberately “misread” those who came before them and repress their debt to them.  
 this was a view that ran counter to the new criticism, the dominant literary theory in midcentury america that put aside matters like historical context and author’s intentions and rather saw literature as a series of texts to be closely analyzed, their meaning to be found in language and structure. 
 professor bloom crossed swords with other critical perspectives in “the western canon.” the eminent critic frank kermode, identifying those whom professor bloom saw as his antagonists, wrote in the london review of books, “he has in mind all who profess to regard the canon as an instrument of cultural, hence political, hegemony — as a subtle fraud devised by dead white males to reinforce ethnic and sexist oppression.” 
 professor bloom insisted that a literary work is not a social document — is not to be read for its political or historical content — but is to be enjoyed above all for the aesthetic pleasure it brings. “bloom isn’t asking us to worship the great books,” the writer adam begley wrote in the new york times magazine in 1994. “he asks instead that we prize the astonishing mystery of creative genius.”  
 professor bloom himself said that “the canonical quality comes out of strangeness, comes out of the idiosyncratic, comes out of originality.” mr. begley noted further, “the canon, bloom believes, answers an unavoidable question: what, in the little time we have, shall we read?”  
 “you must choose,” professor bloom himself wrote in “the western canon.” “either there were aesthetic values or there are only the overdeterminations of race, class and gender.”  
 attached to “the western canon” is an appendix listing the works of some 850 writers that professor bloom thought would endure in posterity. plato and shakespeare and proust are there, of course, but so are lesser-known figures, like ivo andric, a yugoslav who won the 1961 nobel prize in literature, and taha hussein, an important egyptian writer and intellectual.  
 many in the literary world delighted in trying to decipher the meanings behind professor bloom’s sometimes idiosyncratic choices. some puzzled over his judgment, for example, that of all john updike’s considerable body of work, only the novel “the witches of eastwick” would last. professor bloom’s critics noted that mr. updike had once referred to professor bloom’s writings as “torturous.” philip roth, a friend of professor bloom’s, garnered six mentions. alice walker was ignored altogether, but the poet j.d. mcclatchy and the critics david bromwich and barbara packer, all students of professor bloom’s, made the cut. 
 later, in “the anatomy of influence” — a 2011 book he called, prematurely, his “virtual swan song” — professor bloom seemed to soften his canonical stance, conceding that a critic of any heritage is obliged to take seriously other traditions, including non-western. 
 the spotlight he commanded as a powerful cultural figure did not always flatter him. in 1990, gq magazine, in an article titled “bloom in love,” portrayed him as having had intimate entanglements with female students. (“a disgusting piece of character assassination,” he was quoted as telling mr. begley in the times magazine.) and in a 2004 article in new york magazine, the writer naomi wolf wrote that he had once put his hand on her inner thigh when she was an undergraduate student. “beautiful, brilliant students surrounded him,” she wrote. “he was a vortex of power and intellectual charisma.”  
 professor bloom vigorously denied her accusation.  
 the clarity of his prose was also questioned. “harold is not a particularly good explainer,” his friend the poet john hollander once told the times, adding, “he’ll get hold of a word and allow this to generate a concept for him, but he’s not in a position to say very clearly what he means and what he’s doing.” 
 still, professor bloom won huge book advances — $1.2 million in the case of “genius: a mosaic of one hundred exemplary creative minds” (2002), a popular but erudite work on which great books a person ought to read. 
 harold bloom was born on july 11, 1930, in the east bronx, into an orthodox jewish household. he was the youngest of five children of william and paula (lev) bloom, struggling immigrants from eastern europe. his father was a garment worker.  
 the first book harold read was an anthology of yiddish poetry. he soon discovered the new york public library’s branch in the melrose section of the bronx and worked his way through hart crane, w.h. auden and t.s. eliot. he graduated from the exclusive bronx high school of science — “that ghastly place,” he called it — and went to cornell on a scholarship, where he dazzled his professors. 
 when he graduated from cornell in 1951, his teachers insisted that he go to another institution for graduate school. “we couldn’t teach him anything more,” said m.h. abrams, the eminent critic and scholar of romanticism who was professor bloom’s adviser. 
 professor bloom was accepted at yale, a stronghold of the new criticism in the 1950s. the new critics, among them t.s. eliot, favored 17th-century metaphysical and religious poets like john donne and george herbert, both clergymen. professor bloom found that school of thought arid. 
 it was “no accident,” the young professor bloom wrote, “that the poets brought into favor by the new criticism were catholics or high church anglicans.” he added that the “academic criticism of literature in our time became almost an affair of church wardens.” 
  “and i am very jewish,” he told a reporter, “and lower-class jewish at that.”  
 his heroes were emerson and the english romantics, but romanticism was in ill repute at yale. nevertheless, he wrote his doctoral thesis on romanticism and adapted and published it as his first book, “shelley’s mythmaking” (1959). he published a more comprehensive study of the romantics, “the visionary company,’’ in 1961. in championing the romantics he was credited with helping to persuade english departments to teach them again in the 1960s.  
 at yale, however, he cast himself in direct opposition to the prevailing ethos, particularly with “the anxiety of influence,” positing that great literature is an act of rebellion against the writers who came before. though he briefly aligned himself with the yale deconstructionists paul de man, j. hillis miller, jacques derrida and geoffrey hartman, professor bloom broke with the yale english department completely in 1977. he was appointed de vane professor of humanities and eventually sterling professor of the humanities, the highest academic rank at yale, in effect becoming a department unto himself. 
 in 1984 professor bloom took on a vast project: editing some 600 volumes of criticism for chelsea house, a publisher of scholarly works. one motive for doing so was to provide for a disabled adult son. the next year he received a so-called genius award grant from the catherine and john d. macarthur foundation. 
 professor bloom took on a greater teaching load in 1988, spending part of each week as the berg professor of english at new york university.  
 at his death he lived in the same rambling 19th-century brown-shingled house in new haven that he and his wife, jeanne, a retired psychologist in the branford, conn., school system, had occupied for more than 50 years and filled with thousands of books, paintings and sculptures. he had married jeanne gould in 1958. 
 in addition to his wife, professor bloom is survived by two sons, daniel and david. 
 professor bloom was ultimately both optimistic, in a narrow sense, and pessimistic, in a much broader one, about the durability of great literature. the books he loved would no doubt always find readers, he wrote, though their numbers might dwindle. but his great concern was that the books would no longer be taught, and thus become irrelevant. 
 “what are now called ‘departments of english’ will be renamed departments of ‘cultural studies,’” he wrote in “the western canon,” “where batman comics, mormon theme parks, television, movies and rock will replace chaucer, shakespeare, milton, wordsworth and wallace stevens. 
 “major, once-elitist universities and colleges,” he continued, “will still offer a few courses in shakespeare, milton and their peers, but these will be taught by departments of three or four scholars, equivalent to teachers of ancient greek and latin.”

 to prepare, find areas in the paper that you’d like to use. look for nice typography, colors, patterns or photographs. (tip: try to save the times’s at home and kids sections, which always have gorgeous colors and illustrations.) once you start collecting decorative pages to cut up, you’ll never look at a newspaper the same way again.

 step 1. draw shapes on newspaper, using templates, stencils or trace items such as drinking glasses and coins. (to make your own templates, draw a shape onto scrap cardboard and cut it out. you can hand-draw shapes like hearts or find them online via image searches. print out the shapes, tape them to cardboard and cut them out.) 
 step 2. cut out your shapes. tip: if using a craft punch, insert newspaper as well as a sheet of plain paper (like printer paper) to keep the punch from catching and tearing the newspaper. you can cut your shapes into parts, like semicircles, and mix them up. 
 step 3. lay your shapes on the card. when you make a pleasing arrangement, adhere them to the card with a glue stick. 
 step 4. to make the balloon card, punch or cut circles and glue them down. attach string with little dots of white glue. cut a small triangle and glue it to cover the spot where the string meets the circle.

 whether they are direct stimulus payments, an array of tax benefits or an expansion of the affordable care act, the bill will bring a big economic lift to middle-income families. in some cases, those households will have weathered the pandemic relatively unscathed, and those who are concerned about the cost of the legislation have suggested that the definition of middle class has expanded to include families who are actually well-off. 
 an analysis by the tax policy center published this week estimated that middle-income families, those making $51,000 to $91,000 per year, will see their after-tax income rise by 5.5 percent as a result of the tax changes and stimulus payments in the legislation. the increase for that income group is about twice as generous as what it received after the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act. 
 targeting a relief package more narrowly to help those solidly in the middle class has been challenging, given the cost of living varies widely in different parts of the united states. 
 “for a lot of the country, $160,000 buys you the house on the hill,” said howard gleckman, a senior fellow at the urban-brookings tax policy center, who pointed out that a couple making that level of income in new york city, for example, would be stretched. 
 marc goldwein, the senior policy director for the committee for a responsible federal budget, estimated that a family of five with household income of $150,000 could receive about $10,000 from the federal government this year, suggesting that the stimulus package would do much more than alleviate poverty. 
 many economists argue that directing aid to the poorest will have the biggest benefit because they are most likely to quickly turn around and spend the money on groceries, rent and other necessities, stimulating the economy. however, after a year of avoiding travel and dining, middle-class families are also likely to splurge as the pandemic subsides. 
 the biden administration and democrats in congress are betting that by flooding the economy with cash they can kick-start a faster recovery. 
 here are some of the ways that bill will help the middle class. 
 this time around, americans will receive stimulus checks of up to $1,400 per person, including dependents. 
 the size of the payments are scaled down for individuals making more than $75,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000. and they are cut off for individuals making $80,000 or more and couples earning more than $160,000. 
 those thresholds are lower than in the previous relief bills, to better ensure that those who need the checks the most receive them. but they will still be one of the biggest benefits enjoyed by those who are solidly in the middle class. 
 the relief package, known as the american rescue plan, includes some important changes to existing tax policy to help families with children who have been struggling to care for them as the pandemic closed schools. 
 the most significant change is to the child tax credit, which will be increased to up to $3,600 (for children under 6) for 2021 from $2,000 per child. the credit, which is refundable for people with low tax bills, is $3,000 per child for children ages 6 to 17. 
 the existing credit tops out for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $400,000. as with the stimulus payments, the expanded credit will phase out for individuals making more than $75,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000. 
 the legislation also bolsters the tax credits that parents receive to subsidize the cost of child care this year. the current credit is worth 20 percent to 35 percent of eligible expenses with a maximum value of $2,100 for two or more qualifying individuals. the stimulus bill increases that amount to $4,000 for one qualifying individual or $8,000 for two or more. 
 the value of the credit will be calculated by taking up to 50 percent of the value of eligible expenses, up to certain limits, depending on household income. the law would begin to reduce the credit below 20 percent for households with income of more than $400,000. 
 after four years of being on life support, the affordable care act is expanding, a development that will largely reward middle-income individuals and families, since those on the lower end of the income spectrum generally qualify for medicaid. the relief legislation expands the subsidies for buying health insurance. as a result, a 64-year-old earning $58,000 would see monthly payments decline to $412 from $1,075 under current law, according to the congressional budget office. 
 the legislation will now make upper-middle-income americans eligible for aid to buy plans on the government exchanges, and premiums for those plans will cost no more than 8.5 percent of an individual’s modified adjusted gross income. 
 another benefit to the middle class is that the stimulus package makes it easier for newly unemployed workers to get insurance through a federal program called cobra, which allows people to buy their former employers’ health benefits. cobra premiums will be fully paid for through september. 
 one of the more controversial provisions in the legislation is the $86 billion allotted to fixing failing multiemployer pensions. 
 the money is a taxpayer bailout for about 185 union pension plans that are so close to collapse that without the rescue, more than a million retired truck drivers, retail clerks, builders and others could be forced to forgo retirement income. the plans cover about 10.7 million active and retired workers, many of whom are middle class and work in fields like construction or entertainment where the workers move from job to job. 
 the legislation gives the weakest plans enough money to pay hundreds of thousands of retirees — a number that will grow in the future — their full pensions for the next 30 years. 
 but the measure has drawn criticism because the pensions were failing well before the pandemic.",10542

 the majority of people in the united states are under a form of stay-at-home order to try to squelch the deadly coronavirus pandemic, yet some still have their reasons for wanting to drive across parts of the country. 
 in the last days, the new york times has heard from people who have older parents in need of assistance, a new grandmother in ohio whose daughter in north carolina wants help with the baby, and those who were scheduled to move to a new job or home, all seeking advice on whether a road trip was advisable or even feasible. 
 the constitution guarantees the right to enter one state and leave another, but jurisdictions can require quarantines or statements of purpose. dr. anthony fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor, has said the white house coronavirus task force “literally every day” considers the possibility of restricting domestic travel in certain areas.

 researchers, writing in bmj, reviewed 72 prospective studies that included more than two and a half million participants with data on body fat and mortality. they found that central adiposity — a large waist — was consistently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality. in pooled data from 50 studies, each four-inch increase in waist size was associated with an 11 percent increased relative risk for premature death. the association was significant after adjusting for smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption. 
 waist size is an indicator of the amount of visceral fat, or fat stored in the abdomen around the internal organs. this kind of fat is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and alzheimer’s disease. 
 but increased fat in two places appears to be associated with a lower risk of death. three studies showed that each two-inch increase in thigh circumference was associated with an 18 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. in nine studies involving almost 300,000 participants, a four-inch increase in a woman’s hip circumference was associated with a 10 percent lower risk of death. 
 “thigh size is an indicator of the amount of muscle, which is protective,” said a co-author of the review, tauseef ahmad khan, a postdoctoral fellow at the university of toronto. “and hip fat is not visceral fat, but subcutaneous fat, which is considered beneficial.” 
 comparing waist size with other bodily measurements reveals still more information about the risk for premature death. given two people with the same hip size, the person with the larger waist is at higher risk for premature mortality. 
 for example, consider one man with a 34-inch waist and 37-inch hips, and another with the same hip size but a 41-inch waist. the latter’s relative risk of death, the researchers found, was almost 50 percent higher. small changes in this waist-to-hip ratio make a big difference: in 31 studies that reported the ratio, each 0.1 unit increase in waist-to-hip ratio was associated with a 20 percent higher relative risk of death, with a stronger association in women than in men. 
 it is unclear if there is a risk in having too small a waist. “there is a range in these measures,” dr. khan said, “a range in which these numbers are beneficial. above that range, there is higher risk, but more research has to be done about lower ranges.” 
 losing excess weight is of course desirable, but there is probably no way to redistribute weight, or lose weight in the waist alone. “it doesn’t work that way,” said dr. khan. “you have to reduce overall weight, and that also reduces central fatness.” 
 there is a way to put many of these various factors together in a single measurement, using a formula called a.b.s.i., or a body shape index. this calculation includes not only weight and height, like b.m.i., or body mass index, but also age, sex and waist circumference. it may produce a more accurate estimate of risk, the authors say. 
 a.b.s.i. is used mostly as a research tool, but anyone can calculate it here: https://www.fatcalc.com/absi. each 0.005 unit increase in a.b.s.i. was associated with a 15 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality. 
 “the takeaway message is watch your waist size,” dr. khan said. “it’s more important than a simple measure of weight. you can have a normal weight and b.m.i., but if your waist is large, that puts you at high risk.”",1526

 some called it a nuclear winter. cars kept their headlights on. office towers in san francisco, where the smoke is mixing with fog, were illuminated as if in the middle of the night. 
 across northern california, giant plumes of smoke from a fire that blasted through the foothills of the sierra nevada billowed and spread high in the atmosphere, blotting out the sun. 
 the bear fire, as it is known, added to the smoke already pumped into the atmosphere by the more than 20 large fires burning across california. 
 craig shoemaker, a meteorologist with the national weather service in sacramento, said the immense volume of smoke from the bear fire rose overnight to 40,000 feet, an altitude where the air is frigid. 
 “we have a huge cloud of ash and ice,” he said, adding that the plume resembled thunderclouds. 
 fires are essentially creating their own weather, mr. shoemaker said. “without the smoke, it would be a clear day,” he said. “this is all generated from the fires.” 
 changing wind patterns will start to push the smoke eastward, potentially clearing the air near the coast, mr. shoemaker said, but he added a caveat. 
 early in the week, the winds blew wildfire smoke hundreds of miles out over the pacific ocean. as they reverse, that old smoke will probably be pushed back ashore.",12910

 one of the most intense protests was in seattle, where a day of demonstrations focused on police violence left a trail of broken windows and people flushing pepper spray from their eyes. at least 45 protesters had been arrested as of early evening, and both protesters and police officers suffered injuries. 
 carrying signs such as “feds go home” and shouting chants of “no justice, no peace,” some among the crowd of about 5,000 protesters stopped at a youth detention center and lit several construction trailers there on fire. some smashed windows of nearby businesses, ignited a fire in a coffee shop and blew an eight-inch hole through the wall of the seattle police department’s east precinct building, the police said. 
 “at this point, we declared the event to be a riot, and several orders to disperse were given,” the seattle police chief, carmen best, said at a news conference. 
 the police responded by firing flash grenades, showering protesters with pepper spray and abruptly rushing into crowds, knocking people to the ground. after a flash grenade left one woman with bloody injuries, police officers shoved people who had stopped to help her. 
 in austin, texas, the police said one man was shot and killed just before 10 p.m. during a protest in the city’s downtown. in a live video from the scene, protesters are seen marching through an intersection when a car blares its horn. seconds later, five shots ring out, followed shortly after by several more loud bangs. 
 the man who was killed may have approached a vehicle with a rifle before he was shot and killed, officer katrina ratcliff said. ms. ratcliff said the person who shot and killed the man had fired from inside the vehicle. that person was detained and is cooperating with officers, she said. no one else was injured. 
 “all i know is that someone dying while protesting is horrible,” mayor steve adler of austin said in a statement. “our city is shaken and, like so many in our community, i’m heartbroken and stunned.” 
 in los angeles, protesters clashed with officers in front of the federal courthouse downtown. videos showed people smashing windows and lobbing water bottles at officers after protesters said the police fired projectiles at them. 
 the federal courthouse in portland has been the scene of nightly, chaotic demonstrations for weeks, which continued again into sunday morning, as thousands participated in marches around the city, the 59th consecutive day of protests there. earlier, a group of nurses in scrubs had joined an organized group of mothers in helmets and fathers in hard hats, all assembled against the fence of a federal courthouse where federal agents — a deployment that has been a key focus of the recent demonstrations — have been assembled. 
 shortly after 1 a.m., the portland police said the protest had become a riot and ordered the crowd to leave. federal agents fired tear gas and left the courthouse to drive protesters from the streets, continuing to stretch the boundaries of their authority as legal experts questioned how far the agents could stray beyond federal property. 
 protesters in several cities said the smoke-filled videos of federal agents firing tear gas and shoving protesters in portland had brought them to the streets on saturday. 
 “portland is leading,” said chantelle hershberger, an organizer with refuse fascism who was part of the los angeles activists protesting the presence of federal agents in portland, where city officials have opposed the presence of the federal officers. “they’re showing what it looks like to stay in the streets despite police oppression, despite the federal forces being sent in. this kind of energy is actually what’s needed.” 
 bipasha mukherjee, 52, of kirkland, wash., said she has been protesting on the streets since may and said it was worrisome to her to see such aggressive tactics by the police. 
 “this is not the country i immigrated to,” said ms. mukherjee, who arrived from india more than 30 years ago. “it feels like we are rapidly becoming a fascist state and a police state.” 
 michaud savage of seattle said the protests there were aimed at both local authorities and the deployment of federal officers who have waged a crackdown against a long-running protest in portland. mr. savage said the law enforcement tactics in portland, which have included the use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions, were dangerous and inappropriate. 
 “it’s a very hard slide in an extremely violent direction,” mr. savage said as he washed his eyes of pepper spray and nursed a wound on his arm from a flash grenade. 
 but ms. best, the seattle police chief, said a number of demonstrators also used violence. some were tossing concrete blocks from a rooftop to the street below, she said. the coffee shop that was set afire had occupied apartments above it that had to be evacuated, she said. 
 “we support everyone’s first amendment right for free speech and to gather and assemble in such a way,” she said. “but what we saw today was not peaceful. it was not a peaceful demonstration at all, and criminal acts were occurring throughout the city, and many people were at risk.” 
 other demonstrations took place on saturday in new york, omaha and oakland, calif., among other cities. 
 in omaha, kmtv-tv reported that demonstrators turned out in solidarity with the portland protests and also in response to the death of james scurlock, a black man killed by a white bar owner in may. the police arrested 75 to 100 people saturday night, kmtv reported. 
 in richmond, va., riot police fired chemical agents at hundreds of protesters who had marched through the city and gathered around the richmond police department. the police said some protesters had set fire to a city-owned dump truck outside the station. 
 at a protest in aurora, colo., a hectic scene played out as people marched along an interstate highway. 
 during that protest, someone drove a car into demonstrators, the aurora police department said, although it was unclear if the car struck any protesters. the police said a protester had also “decided to fire off a weapon,” which struck at least one other person. that person was taken to a hospital and was in stable condition, the police said, and a second person later showed up to the hospital with a graze wound. 
 transcript 
 federal officers in military gear … … clouds of tear gas … … crowd control munitions … [shots fired] … and locals who want those officers gone. “what are you guys protecting?” “get the [expletive] out of our city!” in just over a week, the chaotic scenes in portland grabbed the nation’s attention and raised questions about whether the u.s. government is exceeding its authority and violating civil rights. the officers came because of an executive order signed by president trump in late june to protect federal property from destruction. “if we didn’t take a stand in portland, you know, we’ve arrested many of these leaders. if we didn’t take that stand, right now you would have a problem like — they were going to lose portland.” so what’s going on here? and what methods are the officers using to protect federal sites? crowd: “breonna taylor!” the protests against racism and police brutality, which started in may, had largely been peaceful and were held across portland. but after federal officers arrived in the city on july 4, demonstrations became centered around this u.s. district courthouse and this building housing federal agencies. both are property of the u.s. government. the buildings have clearly been vandalized, and the department of homeland security has a mandate to protect them. that’s usually done by officers from the federal protective service. but on the ground in portland, we have seen a new task force, including u.s. marshals … … bortac, a unit of customs and border protection … … and a special response team from ice, the immigration and customs enforcement agency. according to a government memo leaked to the times, these units are insufficiently trained to perform crowd control. but that hasn’t stopped them from trying. night after night, videos show these officers emerging from the two federal buildings as protesters draw near. hundreds of videos reviewed by the times show that although protesters were antagonistic, officers often responded with disproportionate force. [shouting] they blanketed streets with tear gas. “are you ok?” they struck protesters with batons … … and used flash bangs, pepper balls and other less-lethal munitions to clear the streets. [chanting] their actions often appeared to escalate rather than de-escalate matters. and in some instances, they attacked when there was no apparent threat. on july 11, protester donavan la bella was at the federal courthouse when an officer appears to have fired at his head in retaliation for tossing a spent tear gas canister. “[expletive] you!” [shot fired] la bella’s mother told local media he suffered skull fractures and needed surgery. later that night when field medics sought officers’ help for a wounded protester, they were aggressively cleared away. on july 18, a navy veteran was batoned and pepper-sprayed in another unprovoked attack. his right hand was broken, and he needs surgery. sometimes members of the press were hit. “he got shot in the back, obviously, and he’s wearing press —” this photographer, mathieu lewis rolland, told the times that a volley of 10 projectiles were fired into his back. “ow, ow, ow!” in the middle of all this, protesters were detained in ways that alarmed civil rights advocates and former homeland security officials. “can your people identify themselves as law enforcement?” on july 15, several federal officers were filmed driving in unmarked vehicles in the blocks around the courthouse. “how are we supposed to know who you are? how are we supposed to know you’re not kidnapping us and you’re civilians kidnapping us?” one protester was detained at this location nearby. “what are you doing?” federal officers wouldn’t identify themselves … “use your words!” … but patches on the right and left sides of their uniforms match those used by members of bortac, the tactical unit from customs and border protection. they drove the protester away in an unmarked car. d.h.s. says federal officers have made 43 arrests since july 4. agents do have the authority to make arrests if they believe that a federal crime has been committed, like damaging federal property or attacking officers. crowd: “hey, hey, ho, ho, these racist cops have got to go.” in recent days, the controversy mobilized a larger and more diverse crowd of protesters. [chanting] a so-called wall of moms led marches through portland’s streets and to the federal courthouse where officers cleared them away. the federal presence has also inflamed tensions. some demonstrators damaged paneling on the courthouse and tried to set them alight. others threw water bottles and fired fireworks toward the building. on wednesday, july 22, portland’s mayor joined the protests and was caught in a cloud of tear gas. “this is a egregious overreaction on the part of the federal officers. this is not a de-escalation strategy. this is flat-out urban warfare.” at around the same time, a customs and border protection plane was spotted circling overhead. c.b.p. officials told the times it was sending a live video feed of the crowd to law enforcement on the ground. crowd: “no justice, no peace! protesters and local officials say this is all a case of federal overreach. oregon’s attorney general has sued the federal government to stop arresting people. “gas! gas! gas!” the president has doubled down, promising to send more federal officers to cities governed by his political rivals. “because we’re not going to let new york and chicago and philadelphia, detroit and baltimore, and all of these — oakland is a mess — we’re not going to let this happen in our country. all run by liberal democrats.” the results could look like a national police force acting under presidential orders, able to ignore local demands and arrest residents. in portland, it has been a recipe for chaos. [explosion] 
 in addition to marching in solidarity with the portland protesters, the demonstration in aurora was also in response to the death of elijah mcclain, a 23-year-old massage therapist who died several days after officers put him in a chokehold last summer. 
 mr. mcclain’s death was one of several that have occurred in police custody around the country that received fresh attention following the police killing of george floyd in minneapolis in may. mr. floyd’s death ignited mass protests that drew millions to the streets in dozens of cities, but the demonstrations waned in most places. 
 seattle and portland, however, have seen extended demonstrations. seattle protesters at one point laid claim to several blocks of the capitol hill neighborhood and declared an autonomous zone. after a series of shootings there led the police to clear the area, protests had subsided. 
 protests in portland, meanwhile, have continued, with some of the heaviest demonstrations around federal buildings in the city. on saturday, crowds marched from near the federal courthouse to a hotel several blocks away where federal agents who had been dispatched to the city were thought to be staying. 
 “get out of bed with the feds,” the protesters chanted. 
 later in the night, thousands of people returned to the federal courthouse. some threw fireworks at the officers protecting the building, while others worked to break down the fence surrounding it. just before midnight, federal officers began lobbing tear gas and flash grenades over the fence, dispersing crowds, while the group of mothers who have been a fixture at the protests stood firm with linked arms, protected with gas masks. 
 craig gabriel, an assistant u.s. attorney in oregon, said at a news conference earlier on saturday that federal agents had arrested 60 people at protests in portland and were pursuing charges against 46 of them. 
 several federal agents had been injured by fireworks and lasers that protesters shone into their eyes, he said. 
 harry fones, a spokesman for the department of homeland security, whose agents are among those clashing with protesters, in on saturday that the demonstrators were little more than “violent anarchists rioting on the streets.” 
 protesters in washington planned to hold a demonstration on sunday at the virginia home of chad f. wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, in response to the deployment of federal agents in portland. 
 after president trump issued an executive order to protect statues and federal property, the department of homeland security sent tactical teams to the city, beginning a series of clashes that have resulted in injured protesters, inspector general investigations and calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave. 
 protest crowds in that city have swelled into the thousands, and demonstrations there were continuing. this week, federal officials deployed a tactical team to seattle as well, and protesters cited that development as one reason for saturday’s demonstrations.

 on today’s episode: 
 megan twohey, an investigative reporter for the new york times, spoke with ms. carroll, lisa birnbach and carol martin. with jessica bennett and alexandra alter, she has published an investigative profile of ms. carroll, in which her friends and confidantes speak publicly for the first time.  
 background reading: 
 the writer’s friends and confidantes talk publicly for the first time about her sexual assault allegation against the president.  
 ms. carroll alleges in a forthcoming book that mr. trump sexually assaulted her in a bergdorf goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s. 
 the president denied the accusations by resorting to a familiar insult: “she’s not my type.” 
 the times’s top editor, dean baquet, acknowledged “we were overly cautious” in our initial coverage of ms. carroll’s accusations.

 in a statement posted on twitter, ms. conway said she was stepping away from a demanding job to spend more time with her four teenage children. “this is completely my choice and my voice,” she said. “in time, i will announce future plans. for now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama.” 
 ms. conway, who is still set to speak at the republican national convention on wednesday night, told mr. trump of her decision to leave on sunday night in the oval office. 
 in a white house famous for its fast revolving door, ms. conway’s survival has made her something akin to a tenured official in an otherwise uncertain workplace. she had been in discussions last week with campaign officials about potentially moving from the white house to the campaign, and traveling to two states a day through the election as a surrogate. but she decided that a job on the road would be equally onerous on her family. 
 her husband, george t. conway iii, a prominent conservative lawyer who has become an outspoken critic of mr. trump’s, said sunday on twitter that he was stepping back from the anti-trump group he has been advising, the lincoln project. mr. conway said he would also take a hiatus from his twitter account, where he regularly criticizes the president and his aides. 
 the conways have known mr. trump for nearly 15 years, meeting him in new york when he was a real estate developer. in 2011, when mr. trump was considering running for president, ms. conway, then a pollster with her own company, was one of the people mr. trump consulted with about a possible campaign. 
 since the 2016 campaign, when she served as mr. trump’s final campaign manager, ms. conway has been one of the president’s most visible defenders, winning his admiration for animated sparring sessions with cable news hosts — and earning criticism and derision from the president’s detractors. ms. conway also advised vice president mike pence when he was the governor of indiana. 
 during her time at the white house, she has asserted herself when other senior administration officials, including jared kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and aides who have long since departed, like stephen k. bannon, the former white house chief strategist, and reince priebus, mr. trump’s first chief of staff, have tried to minimize her. she has stepped into the void by helping to shape communications strategy and speaking to reporters when the white house has had few aides willing to defend the president or his policies publicly. most recently, she has attended all of the coronavirus task force briefings, and encouraged mr. trump to restart his daily news conferences. 
 mr. trump and his family members have defended ms. conway even as her husband, who had initially been tapped for a job in the administration, became an outspoken critic of the president, accusing him regularly of having narcissistic personality disorder.

 mr. trump pressed the speaker, bryan cutler, on how republicans planned to reverse the results of an election that mr. biden was certified to have won by more than 80,000 votes, a spokesman for mr. cutler, michael straub, said monday night. 
 “he did ask what options were available to the legislature,” mr. straub said, referring to the president. 
 a series of lawsuits by the trump campaign and its allies claiming widespread voting fraud in pennsylvania have been tossed out of state and federal courts. 
 supporters of mr. trump’s baseless fraud claims have called on republican-led legislatures in several states to overturn the results, although pennsylvania’s general assembly is out of session and cannot be called back except by gov. tom wolf, a democrat. 
 “cutler made it very clear what power the legislature has and does not have,” said mr. straub, who characterized the president’s calls as seeking information rather than pressuring the speaker. the calls were reported earlier by the washington post. 
 pennsylvania is the third state in which mr. trump is known to have reached out to top elected republicans to try to reverse the will of voters. he earlier summoned michigan legislative leaders to the white house, and over the weekend he pressed gov. brian kemp of georgia to call upon that state’s legislature to reverse the election. 
 at a rally in georgia on saturday, mr. trump said mr. kemp “could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing.” but mr. kemp has repeatedly declined to call for a special session of the legislature, and state election officials recertified georgia’s results on monday after another recount again showed that mr. biden had won the state. 
 nearly every state has certified its results, and mr. biden has officially secured more than the 270 electoral college votes needed to become president. 
 in pennsylvania, mr. biden was certified the winner last month by the department of state, and mr. wolf signed a “certificate of ascertainment” for mr. biden’s slate of electors to be appointed to the electoral college, which votes on dec. 14. 
 nonetheless, 64 republicans in the general assembly, including mr. cutler and other members of the leadership, called on friday for pennsylvania’s congressional delegation to reject the electoral votes for mr. biden when congress meets on jan. 6 to confirm the electoral college results. the effort is highly unlikely, not least because the democratic-led house of representatives would need to agree to it. pennsylvania’s most senior congressional republican, senator pat toomey, has said through his office that he “will not be objecting” to mr. biden’s 20 electoral votes from the state. 
 mr. trump’s personal attacks on the few top republicans who debunk his fraud claims, such as in georgia and arizona, as well as his efforts to enlist allies in the party in his brazen effort to reverse the will of voters, such as in pennsylvania, are likely to make the issue crucial to elections next year and in the 2022 midterms. republican primaries could become contests of who stood behind mr. trump in his baseless claims that undermined faith in democracy. 
 state representative joanna e. mcclinton, the minority leader of the pennsylvania house democrats, called republican assertions of widespread fraud, which have echoed mr. trump’s descent into conspiracy theories and disinformation, “outrageous.” 
 “we are seeing extremists who claim they love the constitution,” she said, “but who want to throw the constitution away just because the president lost his bid for re-election.”",10405

 in a statement released by the sanders campaign, mr. de blasio said he was supporting mr. sanders because he “stands with working families” and was the right candidate to take on president trump. 
 “i have called for a bold, progressive agenda, and that’s exactly what senator sanders has championed for decades,” mr. de blasio said. 
 his choice is a reversal from four years ago, when he endorsed hillary clinton over mr. sanders, but it is not entirely unexpected. he said last summer that in retrospect, he believed mr. sanders would have won the 2016 election if nominated. 
 it is also notable that mr. de blasio chose to make the endorsement only now, after mr. sanders’s victory in new hampshire and strong performance in iowa have made him a clear front-runner for the nomination. 
 mr. de blasio was expected to travel with mr. sanders on sunday and monday in nevada, where they will appear together at canvassing events ahead of the caucuses there on feb. 22. 
 mr. de blasio and mr. sanders have spoken several times since the mayor ended his presidential campaign in september. the mayor also spent time at mr. sanders’s vacation home in vermont in 2018. and mr. sanders swore mr. de blasio in at the inauguration for his second term as mayor. 
 though mr. de blasio ran for mayor — and, later, president — on an unapologetically progressive platform, he has generally not endorsed progressive insurgents. he did not endorse zephyr teachout in 2014 or cynthia nixon in 2018 when they challenged gov. andrew m. cuomo from the left. nor did he endorse tiffany cabán in the queens district attorney’s race last year, as mr. sanders and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts both did. 
 mr. de blasio’s backing adds to mr. sanders’s list of endorsements, which includes numerous unions and grass-roots organizations as well as representatives alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york, ilhan omar of minnesota and rashida tlaib of michigan. 
 mr. de blasio was in the presidential race for only four months last year and never exceeded 1 percent in a debate-qualifying poll; even voters in new york did not support him. but in something of a twist, his predecessor as mayor, michael r. bloomberg, has reached double digits in recent national polls with a veritable tsunami of spending from his personal fortune.",8098

 so at the end of march, as a crush of covid-19 patients began overwhelming hospitals in new york city, i volunteered to spend 10 days at bellevue, helping at the hospital where i trained. over those days, i realized that we are not detecting the deadly pneumonia the virus causes early enough and that we could be doing more to keep patients off ventilators — and alive. 
 on the long drive to new york from my home in new hampshire, i called my friend nick caputo, an emergency physician in the bronx, who was already in the thick of it. i wanted to know what i was facing, how to stay safe and what his insights into airway management with this disease were. “rich,” he said, “it’s like nothing i’ve ever seen before.” 
 he was right. pneumonia caused by the coronavirus has had a stunning impact on the city’s hospital system. normally an e.r. has a mix of patients with conditions ranging from the serious, such as heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries, to the non-life-threatening, such as minor lacerations, intoxication, orthopedic injuries and migraine headaches. 
 during my recent time at bellevue, though, almost all the e.r. patients had covid pneumonia. within the first hour of my first shift i inserted breathing tubes into two patients. 
 even patients without respiratory complaints had covid pneumonia. the patient stabbed in the shoulder, whom we x-rayed because we worried he had a collapsed lung, actually had covid pneumonia. in patients on whom we did ct scans because they were injured in falls, we coincidentally found covid pneumonia. elderly patients who had passed out for unknown reasons and a number of diabetic patients were found to have it. 
 and here is what really surprised us: these patients did not report any sensation of breathing problems, even though their chest x-rays showed diffuse pneumonia and their oxygen was below normal. how could this be? 
 we are just beginning to recognize that covid pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call “silent hypoxia” — “silent” because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature. 
 pneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. but when covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don’t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. and by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest x-rays). normal oxygen saturation for most persons at sea level is 94 to 100 percent; covid pneumonia patients i saw had oxygen saturations as low as 50 percent. 
 to my amazement, most patients i saw said they had been sick for a week or so with fever, cough, upset stomach and fatigue, but they only became short of breath the day they came to the hospital. their pneumonia had clearly been going on for days, but by the time they felt they had to go to the hospital, they were often already in critical condition. 
 in emergency departments we insert breathing tubes in critically ill patients for a variety of reasons. in my 30 years of practice, however, most patients requiring emergency intubation are in shock, have altered mental status or are grunting to breathe. patients requiring intubation because of acute hypoxia are often unconscious or using every muscle they can to take a breath. they are in extreme duress. covid pneumonia cases are very different. 
 a vast majority of covid pneumonia patients i met had remarkably low oxygen saturations at triage — seemingly incompatible with life — but they were using their cellphones as we put them on monitors. although breathing fast, they had relatively minimal apparent distress, despite dangerously low oxygen levels and terrible pneumonia on chest x-rays. 
 we are only just beginning to understand why this is so. the coronavirus attacks lung cells that make surfactant. this substance helps the air sacs in the lungs stay open between breaths and is critical to normal lung function. as the inflammation from covid pneumonia starts, it causes the air sacs to collapse, and oxygen levels fall. yet the lungs initially remain “compliant,” not yet stiff or heavy with fluid. this means patients can still expel carbon dioxide — and without a buildup of carbon dioxide, patients do not feel short of breath. 
 share your stories from the front lines we want to hear from doctors, nurses and health care workers around the world. 
 patients compensate for the low oxygen in their blood by breathing faster and deeper — and this happens without their realizing it. this silent hypoxia, and the patient’s physiological response to it, causes even more inflammation and more air sacs to collapse, and the pneumonia worsens until oxygen levels plummet. in effect, patients are injuring their own lungs by breathing harder and harder. twenty percent of covid pneumonia patients then go on to a second and deadlier phase of lung injury. fluid builds up and the lungs become stiff, carbon dioxide rises, and patients develop acute respiratory failure. 
 by the time patients have noticeable trouble breathing and present to the hospital with dangerously low oxygen levels, many will ultimately require a ventilator. 
 silent hypoxia progressing rapidly to respiratory failure explains cases of covid-19 patients dying suddenly after not feeling short of breath. (it appears that most covid-19 patients experience relatively mild symptoms and get over the illness in a week or two without treatment.) 
 a major reason this pandemic is straining our health system is the alarming severity of lung injury patients have when they arrive in emergency rooms. covid-19 overwhelmingly kills through the lungs. and because so many patients are not going to the hospital until their pneumonia is already well advanced, many wind up on ventilators, causing shortages of the machines. and once on ventilators, many die. 
 avoiding the use of a ventilator is a huge win for both patient and the health care system. the resources needed for patients on ventilators are staggering. vented patients require multiple sedatives so that they don’t buck the vent or accidentally remove their breathing tubes; they need intravenous and arterial lines, iv medicines and iv pumps. in addition to a tube in the trachea, they have tubes in their stomach and bladder. teams of people are required to move each patient, turning them on their stomach and then their back, twice a day to improve lung function. 
 there is a way we could identify more patients who have covid pneumonia sooner and treat them more effectively — and it would not require waiting for a coronavirus test at a hospital or doctor’s office. it requires detecting silent hypoxia early through a common medical device that can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies: a pulse oximeter. 
 pulse oximetry is no more complicated than using a thermometer. these small devices turn on with one button and are placed on a fingertip. in a few seconds, two numbers are displayed: oxygen saturation and pulse rate. pulse oximeters are extremely reliable in detecting oxygenation problems and elevated heart rates. 
 pulse oximeters helped save the lives of two emergency physicians i know, alerting them early on to the need for treatment. when they noticed their oxygen levels declining, both went to the hospital and recovered (though one waited longer and required more treatment). detection of hypoxia, early treatment and close monitoring apparently also worked for boris johnson, the british prime minister. 
 widespread pulse oximetry screening for covid pneumonia — whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors’ offices — could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with covid pneumonia. 
 people using the devices at home would want to consult with their doctors to reduce the number of people who come to the e.r. unnecessarily because they misinterpret their device. there also may be some patients who have unrecognized chronic lung problems and have borderline or slightly low oxygen saturations unrelated to covid-19. 
 all patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus should have pulse oximetry monitoring for two weeks, the period during which covid pneumonia typically develops. all persons with cough, fatigue and fevers should also have pulse oximeter monitoring even if they have not had virus testing, or even if their swab test was negative, because those tests are only about 70 percent accurate. a vast majority of americans who have been exposed to the virus don’t know it. 
 there are other things we can do as well to avoid immediately resorting to intubation and a ventilator. patient positioning maneuvers (having patients lie on their stomach and sides) open up the lower and posterior lungs most affected in covid pneumonia. oxygenation and positioning helped patients breathe easier and seemed to prevent progression of the disease in many cases. in a preliminary study by dr. caputo, this strategy helped keep three out of four patients with advanced covid pneumonia from needing a ventilator in the first 24 hours. 
 to date, covid-19 has killed more than 40,600 people nationwide — more than 10,000 in new york state alone. oximeters are not 100 percent accurate, and they are not a panacea. there will be deaths and bad outcomes that are not preventable. we don’t fully understand why certain patients get so sick, or why some go on to develop multi-organ failure. many elderly people, already weak with chronic illness, and those with underlying lung disease do very poorly with covid pneumonia, despite aggressive treatment. 
 but we can do better. right now, many emergency rooms are either being crushed by this one disease or waiting for it to hit. we must direct resources to identifying and treating the initial phase of covid pneumonia earlier by screening for silent hypoxia. 
 it’s time to get ahead of this virus instead of chasing it.

 harris, whose mother emigrated from india and whose father emigrated from jamaica, is a woman of tamil and african ancestry who identifies as black. that’s why, after biden’s announcement, she was described as the first asian-american and african-american woman on a major-party presidential ticket. 
 not everyone thought this was the right description for harris. several allies of president trump, for example, were quick to dispute the idea that harris was or could be black. the radio host mark levin said harris’s jamaican origins placed her outside the category of african-american. “kamala harris is not an african-american, she is indian and jamaican,” levin said. “her ancestry does not go back to american slavery, to the best of my knowledge her ancestry does not go back to slavery at all.” 
 taking a somewhat different approach, the conservative provocateur dinesh d’souza said harris could not claim to be a descendant of slaves, and thus an african-american, because one of her ancestors may have been a slaveholder. 
 these objections are wrong. jamaica, home to a brutal and violent plantation system, was at the center of the trans-atlantic slave trade, a major node in britain’s atlantic empire, along with the bahamas and its colonies on the north american coast. 
 many jamaicans trace their origins directly to slavery and the mass importation of african captives. based on a genealogical account by her father, there is a strong chance kamala harris is one of them. what’s more, many descendants of enslaved people in the americas have european ancestry on account of the pervasive sexual violence whites perpetuated wherever slavery took root. 
 having said all of that, this bid to contest harris’s identity — which continued on thursday with president trump’s clumsy attempt to stoke another “birther” controversy, this time about a woman born in oakland in 1964 — gives us an opportunity to think more deeply about the contours of racial identity in the united states, and black american identity in particular. 
 a note about terms: i’ve been using “black” and “african-american” somewhat interchangeably here. but there’s a good case to be made that this is a mistake, that “black” denotes a racial category and is inclusive of americans throughout the african diaspora, while “african-american” refers to national origins, specifically descendants of american slaves. but some black americans who are not descendants of slaves claim the term “african-american,” and some who are descendants do not. and “black” also tends to be used in reference to the cultural heritage of americans of african descent. this column is about “blackness” as a category and a culture, so i will stick with “black” as my preferred terminology. 
 my main point is this: black american identity within the united states emerges from the interaction between structures of oppression — slavery, the slave trade and race hierarchy — and the needs and goals of those enmeshed within them. slavery bound african captives together into a group; the desire to assert their personhood — to build community, to find respite, to resist — was cause to adopt a common identity. in turn, that common identity gave those individuals and their descendants a foundation from which to challenge the structures that bound them together in the first place. race hierarchy and racism set in motion a process of group formation and social action, the aim of which was to transcend and overcome racial domination, and racial categorization itself. 
 here, precision is important. black people did not create themselves as “a race.” race is an ideology, not a biological reality. it arose at a particular time in history, for particular reasons, in an effort to resolve the contradiction of a freedom-loving society that held large parts of its population in bondage. the claim? that the enslaved were a different, lesser form of humanity. it was enslavers who deemed their african captives a “race,” but it was those captives who made themselves into a people. had things gone differently — if the american revolution had been emancipatory, for example, with a full commitment to total equality for all people in the new nation — then black americans would have remained a people, but might no longer have been a “race.” 
 race does not exist in the ether. it must be created and recreated, part of a hierarchical system of domination called racism, itself tied to the production and distribution of resources in our society. the violence and forced peonage of the post-reconstruction era; the segregation of jim crow; the white flight, deindustrialization and the ghettoization of inner cities — all of these things created race. 
 in other words, it is the reality of racism — the ongoing production of race by institutions and structures of racial domination — that fuels this process of group formation. in his 1940 book, “dusk of dawn: an essay toward an autobiography of a race concept,” w. e. b. du bois captured this dynamic in a single sentence, the final point in an imagined dialogue with a white interlocutor. “the black man,” he wrote, “is a person who must ride ‘jim crow’ in georgia.” 
 bound together by segregation, discrimination and exploitation, americans of african descent kept building community. and what is crucial to this question of the boundaries of blackness was the sheer rigidity of american race hierarchy. your exact origins did not matter. neither, for that matter, did your skin color. 
 in his autobiography, “a man called white,” a former head of the n.a.a.c.p., walter francis white, recounts a mob attack on his childhood home. white and his family — his mother was said to be a descendant of president william henry harrison and dilsia, an enslaved woman — had light-complexions, with few visible african features. “my skin is white, my eyes are blue, my hair is blond,” wrote white. they were, nonetheless, part of atlanta’s black community, tied to it by heritage and history. it was those ties that made them a target, and it was that experience of racial violence that impressed on white his own identity: “in the flickering light the mob swayed, paused, and began to flow toward us. in that instant there opened up within me a great awareness; i knew then who i was. i was a negro.” 
 (there were black americans who “passed” in white society, but they did so by cutting themselves off from ties to community and family, as illustrated brilliantly in the 1929 novel “passing,” by nella larsen.) 
 the rigidity of race hierarchy in the united states is one important reason that african-descended people from other parts of the world have identified with, and identified themselves as, black americans once in this country. they, too, were bound to the fate of the descendants of american slaves, thrown into this process of group formation. a quick look at some of the most prominent figures in black american history will prove the point. marcus garvey, one of the most significant black nationalists of the 20th century and the founder of one of the largest black fraternal organizations in american history, was a native of jamaica. kwame ture, born stokely carmichael, leader of the student nonviolent coordinating committee in 1966 and 1967, was born in trinidad. shirley chisholm, the first black woman elected to congress and the first black woman to compete for a major-party presidential nomination, was the daughter of immigrants from barbados and british guiana. sidney poitier, harry belafonte, colin powell — the list goes on. 
 let’s return to kamala harris. her family, as she explains in her 2019 memoir, grounded itself in the black community of california’s bay area. “from almost the moment she arrived from india,” harris writes of her mother, “she chose and was welcomed to and enveloped in the black community. it was the foundation of her new american life.” harris, in turn, was raised to understand herself as a black american. “my mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. she knew that her adopted homeland would see maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.” harris, for her part, claims her black identity as much as her indian heritage: “i was born black. i will die black. i’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand,” she said in an interview in 2019. 
 because of heritage, upbringing and the realities of american racism, harris calls herself black and is also understood as black by people within and outside the black community. 
 her story illustrates the basic truth that “black america” is a multitude. there has never been some essential element to blackness, no singular quality or attribute that makes someone a black american. but there is always a context: the context of one’s heritage, the context of one’s community and the context of american racism. 
 perhaps, then, instead of asking “what makes someone black?” it might be better to ask “why do so many americans of african descent claim blackness?” the answer, i think, is similar to what it was when most black people still toiled in bondage. in the face of racism and racial oppression, black identity links us to a history and to a culture, to tools to survive and resources to thrive. it provides refuge and spiritual sustenance. and it connects us to a vital tradition of struggle and perseverance, with many different visions for what it might mean to be free.

 mr. bezos answered by building amazon into a $1.7 trillion behemoth that sold so many different items online it became known as “the everything store.” in the process, he upended the retail industry, turned amazon into a logistics giant, and expanded into cloud computing, streaming entertainment and artificial intelligence-powered devices. for a time, he was the world’s richest person. 
 on tuesday, mr. bezos, 57, said his run at the top of the seattle-based company was over. 
 as amazon reported its latest set of blockbuster financial results, mr. bezos said he planned to hand over the reins this summer and transition into the role of executive chairman. andy jassy, 53, the chief executive of amazon’s cloud computing division, will be promoted to run the entire company. the change will be effective in the third quarter, which starts in july. 
 “as much as i still tap dance into the office, i’m excited about this transition,” mr. bezos wrote in an email to amazon’s employees. as executive chairman, he said, he intends “to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” 
 the changing of the guard is set to ripple out beyond amazon, which mr. bezos has personified for more than two decades. his impact on corporate america and his remaking of the way that goods are sold turned him into one of the world’s most influential technology and business leaders, as well known as the founders of apple and microsoft, steve jobs and bill gates. mr. bezos’ personal wealth also soared to $188 billion, which was surpassed only last month by elon musk. 
 in recent years, mr. bezos had stepped back from much of amazon’s day-to-day business, delegating those responsibilities to two main deputies, including mr. jassy. he instead had focused on amazon’s future and on personal projects. in 2013, he bought the washington post, and has said he spends more than $1 billion a year on blue origin, his space travel company. 
 two years ago, he also got a divorce and became a fixture of tabloids, which gushed over his increasingly visible social life, including on superyachts owned by billionaires like barry diller. 
 but the pandemic pulled mr. bezos back into amazon’s daily operations last spring. as amazon grappled with a flood of e-commerce demand, labor unrest and supply chain challenges brought on by the coronavirus, mr. bezos held daily calls to help make decisions about inventory, talked to government officials and made a much-publicized visit to one of amazon’s warehouses. 
 amazon has now stabilized, and its growth has surged as more people have turned to e-commerce and the company’s prime fast-shipping program, which has more than 150 million members. amazon on tuesday posted a record $125.6 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, while profits more than doubled to $7.2 billion from a year earlier. it was the first time the company had exceeded $100 billion in sales in a single quarter. 
 amazon shows no sign of pulling back from its ambition to push into more corners of the economy. on a call with investment analysts, brian olsavsky, amazon’s finance chief, said the times that the company had “pre-invested” ahead of future growth had paid off. he said amazon would continue spending more on cloud computing infrastructure and groceries, and expand its logistics operations — especially its rapidly growing last-mile delivery network, which depends on half a million contract drivers to deliver packages. 
 mr. bezos is not expected to disappear from amazon. “jeff is really not going anywhere,” mr. olsavsky said, adding that the change was “more a restructuring of who is doing what.” 
 mr. bezos will remain amazon’s biggest shareholder — he owns 10.6 percent of the company, according to filings — and stay on the board of directors. 
 his exit as chief executive was “a personal decision for him,” mr. olsavsky said. “the role of c.e.o. at a place like amazon is an all-encompassing role, and it does leave little time for other things.” 
 other founders of internet companies that have become the world’s largest digital gatekeepers have also stepped back from day-to-day responsibilities as their fortunes swelled and they put more energy toward personal projects. in 2019, larry page and sergey brin, the stanford graduate students who founded google, left their executive roles at google’s parent company, alphabet. they handed the reins to a protégé, sundar pichai. 
 while mr. bezos is leaving at a high point for amazon’s business, the company faces multiple challenges. amazon is under growing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators around the world over whether it is unfairly wielding its clout. 
 in november, european union regulators brought antitrust charges against amazon, saying the company broke competition laws by using its size and access to data to harm smaller merchants that rely on the company to reach customers. and earlier on tuesday, amazon agreed to pay $62 million to the federal trade commission to settle charges that it withheld tips to delivery drivers between 2016 and 2019. 
 amazon has also grappled with growing labor unrest as its work force has ballooned to 1.3 million employees. last year, some of the company’s warehouse workers expressed discomfort with safety conditions amid the pandemic, forcing amazon to undertake emergency actions and to hire even more aggressively. more recently, workers at an amazon fulfillment center in bessemer, ala., have been trying to organize a union. 
 and competition remains stiff. walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and itself an industry-transforming force, recently introduced a competitor to amazon prime called walmart+. it has made major investments in talent and technology to keep pace with amazon, buying jet.com and a slew of other e-commerce companies. 
 amazon’s announcement marks the second major executive transition at the company in the past year. in august, jeff wilke, the chief executive of amazon’s vast consumer business, said he planned to retire in early 2021 after more than two decades with the company. dave clark, who ran the fulfillment and logistics operations, was promoted to replace him. 
 mr. jassy has long been a trusted lieutenant to mr. bezos. mr. jassy, who grew up in new york, joined amazon in 1997 when it was still a start-up and took on different roles as the company expanded. 
 in the early 2000s, mr. jassy became mr. bezos’ “shadow,” accompanying him to meetings and on business trips. he eventually laid the foundation for amazon web services, the cloud computing business, which he grew into an engine of innovation and profit. the cloud business generated $45 billion in sales last year, up 30 percent from a year earlier. 
 mr. jassy and mr. clark have spent nearly their entire careers at amazon and are deeply steeped in its unique corporate culture. mr. olsavsky said that the board discussed succession planning at least every year, and that the “byproduct” of that was evident in the company’s structure and the growing number of people on the senior leadership team. 
 mr. olsavsky said amazon would announce mr. jassy’s successor as head of the cloud business in the coming months. 
 “you really had to pick somebody inside for this company, and andy is the perfect choice,” said matt mcilwain, a managing director at madrona venture group, an early amazon investor. 
 mr. mcilwain said he was somewhat surprised by the timing of the transition, but not the outcome.

 that might sound like a mouthful, but it has become essential for our digital protection. what it stands for is basically two steps to verify that you are who you say you are, so that even if a password falls into the hands of the wrong people, they cannot pretend to be you.  
 here’s how two-factor authentication has generally worked: say, for instance, you enter your user name and password to get into your online bank account. that’s step one. the bank then sends a text message to your phone with a temporary code that must be punched in before the site lets you log in. that’s step two. in this way, you prove your identity by having access to your phone and that code. 
 sounds simple and safer, right? yet barely anyone uses it. according to google, fewer than 10 percent of its users have signed up for two-factor authentication to protect their google accounts for services including email, photos and calendars. 
 “it’s really, really hard to get a user to sign up,” said guemmy kim, google’s head of account security. “it sounds cumbersome.” 
 in reality, it isn’t that complicated. and in recent years, the technique has evolved to become more secure and, in some cases, even easier to use.  
 that’s because in addition to receiving text messages, you can now log in by using codes shown in an app, by plugging in a physical security key or by setting up your phone to receive a notification and hitting a button. more on that below. 
 using just one or two of these methods will go a long way toward preventing an inappropriate person, like a jealous ex or a hacker, from getting access to your account. so here’s a guide to four ways of setting up two-factor authentication on some of the most popular sites — and the pros and cons of each method. 
 let’s start by setting up your instagram account with traditional two-factor authentication using text messages. this is the most common verification technique across apps and websites, though it has some of the biggest vulnerabilities. 
 here’s what to do: 
 inside your instagram app, open settings, then tap privacy and security and select two-factor authentication.  
 enter your phone number. you will receive a text message containing a six-digit code. enter the code. 
 from now on, whenever you log in to your instagram account, you will receive a text message containing a temporary code. this must be entered before you log in. 
 pros: this method is super easy: you do not need to install any additional apps on your phone to receive texts. and if you lose your device or switch to a new phone, you can still receive your login codes as long as you have the same phone number. 
 cons: phone numbers and text messages are susceptible to phishing or hijacking by hackers (though this is unlikely to happen unless you are a high-profile target such as a well-known activist). if you travel abroad, receiving text messages on a foreign carrier can be pricey. and there are security risks in receiving texts on foreign networks in countries with heavy surveillance such as china and russia. 
 another way to start two-factor authentication is to receive a temporary code via a so-called authenticator app. for this example, let’s protect your facebook account with such an app. 
 here’s how it works: 
 on your phone, open your app store and download a free authenticator app, like google authenticator or authy.  
 then on facebook’s website, go to your security and login settings. click “use two-factor authentication,” then “get started.” after re-entering your password, choose authentication app as your security method. from here, follow the onscreen instructions.  
 from now on, whenever you log in to facebook, you can open the authenticator app and look at the temporary six-digit code generated for your facebook account. you must enter this code before being able to log in. 
 pros: you do not need an internet or a cellphone connection to receive a code via an authentication app. most important, a hijacker can’t easily steal your codes from an authenticator app. 
 cons: if you lose your phone or switch to a new one, you have to regain access to your account through a recovery method such as entering a backup code or asking the app provider to reset your account. that can be time consuming. 
 google prompt is a relatively new authentication feature for securing google accounts. instead of receiving a text message with a code, you receive a notification through a google app asking whether the person trying to sign in is you. hitting “yes” logs you in. 
 here are the steps: 
 on gmail.com, go to your account settings and click “security.” click 2-step verification, and then click add google prompt. 
 click get started and select your smartphone.  
 on your phone, open the google or gmail app. google will show a device trying to log in to your account. tap yes on the prompt.  
 from now on, whenever you log in to your gmail account, the gmail or google app will ask whether the person seeking access is you. hitting yes will log you in. 
 pros: it’s easy. receiving a notification requires only an internet connection. selecting yes is faster than typing in a code. 
 cons: not all apps and sites have a prompt-based verification method, meaning your banking site, for example, may still text you a temporary code. if your internet connection is spotty, you may also have a difficult time receiving the prompt. 
 last, let’s go over the most physical two-factor authentication method, which involves plugging in a key. google was one of the first to introduce a security key program in 2017, and many websites, including twitter and facebook, have since adopted the method. 
 here’s how to secure a twitter account with a security key: 
 buy a security key, such as google’s $50 titan security key bundle. 
 on twitter’s website, go to your account settings and click “set up login verification.” enter your phone number, and then punch in the code you receive via text message. 
 in “security key,” click set up. insert the security key into a usb port, and press the button on the key. press the button again to verify the key.  
 the next time you log in to twitter, click “choose different verification method” and select “use your security key.” after plugging the key into your computer, you will be able to log in. 
 pros: for people who are extra paranoid about being phished or hacked, this is one of the most secure authentication methods because physical access to your key is required for logging in. 
 cons: the keys cost money. what’s more, some sites require you to insert the key every time, so if you forget to carry your key, logging in with a backup method can be complicated. and not all web browsers support logging in with security keys.",7291
25.0,0.02251552719820349,0.65829998254776,"school, student, child, parent, college, university, class, teacher, education, family","with the coronavirus still raging and the fall semester approaching, colleges and universities are telling large segments of their student populations to stay home. those who are allowed on campus, they say, will be living in a world where parties are banned, where everyone is frequently tested for the coronavirus and — perhaps most draconian of all — where students attend many if not all their courses remotely, from their dorm rooms. 
 in order to achieve social distancing, many colleges are saying they will allow only 40 to 60 percent of their students to return to campus and live in the college residence halls at any one time, often divided by class year. 
 stanford has said freshmen and sophomores will be on campus when classes start in the fall, while juniors and seniors study remotely from home. harvard announced on monday that it will mainly be first-year students and some students in special circumstances who will be there in the fall; in the spring, freshmen will leave and it will be seniors’ turn. 
 at the same time, very few colleges are offering tuition discounts, even for those students being forced to take classes from home. 
 professors, students and parents all seem to be conflicted over how these plans will work out. 
 pascale bradley, a senior studying english and french literature at yale, is just looking forward to seeing some classmates again. yale is allowing first-year students, juniors and seniors on campus in the fall, but nearly all classes will be taught remotely. 
 “it won’t be the same social life,” she said. “not that students are upset there might not be big parties. people are just looking forward to daily small interactions, being able to sit and study with someone and have a meal with someone.” 
 her father, kirby bradley, is less forgiving. “this just seems to be the worst of all worlds,” said mr. bradley, who owns a video production company. “they are exposing the kids to increased virus risk, something that is arguably justifiable in exchange for in-person learning, which everyone agrees is better than online. but no, the kids will do remote learning, from campus! at full tuition!” 
 college administrators say they are in a bind and doing the best they can to bring students back to campus to get at least some of the social and academic benefits of being surrounded by their peers. 
 “this pandemic is among the worst crises ever to hit princeton, or college education more broadly,” christopher l. eisgruber, president of princeton, said in his reopening announcement. “princeton’s preferred model of education emphasizes in-person engagement, but in-person engagement is what spreads this terrible virus.” 
 princeton is one of the few universities that has said it would offer a tuition discount this fall because of the limitations. students, whether on campus or learning remotely, will be charged 10 percent less — $48,501 for the coming year, instead of $53,890, according to a spokesman, ben chang. it was unclear how students receiving financial aid — who account for more than 60 percent of undergraduates — would be affected. 
 princeton said it was instituting the policy because most undergraduates would be on campus only half the year — freshmen and juniors in the fall, sophomores and seniors in the spring. 
 harvard university announced on monday that no more than 40 percent of its undergraduates would be allowed on campus at a time during the next academic year, but that tuition would remain the same. all first-year students would be allowed in the fall semester, along with some students in other years whose home environments are not conducive to learning; the freshmen would leave in the spring to make space for seniors to finish and graduate on campus. 
 at harvard, all classes will be held online, even for students living on campus. while it is not discounting its tuition and fees — about $54,000 for the year — the university said it would offer a summer term next year of two tuition-free courses for all students who had to study away from campus for the full academic year. 
 cutting down the number of students on campus will allow many colleges to offer everyone a single or double dormitory bedroom. students are being told they will have to eat takeout meals from dining halls in their rooms, or perhaps make a reservation to eat. 
 many universities are requiring behavioral contracts in which students agree to wear face masks in public, to be tested regularly for the coronavirus, and to limit travel and socializing. if they break the rules, they can be disciplined. 
 universities say they are keeping a tight rein on students because the trajectory of the virus is still uncertain. several universities cited the recent surge in virus cases in some states as justification for keeping classes virtual, even for students living on campus. 
 faculty members are also worried. more than 850 members of the georgia tech faculty have signed a letter opposing the school’s reopening plans for the fall, which say that wearing face masks on campus would not be mandatory, just “strongly encouraged.” 
 the montana university system is also facing pushback from the faculty over its mask policy. 
 international students may have the hardest time of all. many have returned to their home countries and will not be able to re-enter the united states because of travel and visa restrictions. 
 u.s. immigration and customs enforcement said in a statement on monday that student visas would not be issued to people enrolled in schools or programs that are fully online for the fall semester. students in such programs will not be permitted to enter the country, and those already in the united states “must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction, to remain in lawful status.” 
 under pressure both to return to normal — president trump wrote on twitter on monday that “schools must open in the fall!!!” — and to keep students and faculty safe, universities are fighting back against the perception that virtual classes are inferior. 
 a video touts the sophistication of a studio system of creating and recording virtual lecture classes at johns hopkins, where first- and second-year students are being invited to apply for housing. 
 the video shows professors delivering their lectures in a large bright studio, almost as if they were actors onstage, while the eager faces of students look back at them from oversize video screens.  
 many universities are bracing for the possibility that upperclassmen will request leaves of absence until things return to normal. the schools are warning students that if they do, there may not be dormitory housing for them in a year or two when they come back. 
 cornell university is bucking the trend and allowing all its students back to campus, with a mixture of in-person and online instruction. cornell said it based its decision on an analysis that found that conducting a semester entirely remotely could result in far more students becoming infected — up to 10 times as many — compared with reopening the campus. that is because of the likelihood that even if classes were conducted remotely, many cornell students would return to off-campus housing in ithaca, n.y., and the university would not be able to enforce virus testing requirements or restrictions on their behavior. 
 rutgers university said on monday that its fall semester would combine a majority of remotely delivered courses with a limited number of in-person classes. 
 “we have wanted very fervently to be able to resume some version of a normal semester,” jonathan holloway, the university’s president, said in a message to the rutgers community. 
 the university of pennsylvania is also pursuing a “hybrid model” in the fall, with classroom instruction “where it can be provided safely and when it is essential to the academic needs of the course curriculum,” while other courses like large lecture classes are held online. 
 many schools suspended their usual grading policies amid the chaos of the spring term, substituting a pass/fail system instead. now they say they are planning to restore normal grading policies.

9.0,0.022215737064112832,0.8003000020980835,"court, law, justice, rule, judge, case, federal, supreme, legal, administration","washington — the supreme court sided on thursday with the trump administration’s efforts to speed the deportation of asylum seekers, ruling that a law limiting the role of federal courts in reviewing those decisions was constitutional. 
 last week, the supreme court ruled in favor of young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers, allowing them to continue to use a program that shields them from deportation and allows them to work. thursday’s decision, which barred immigrants whose asylum claims were rejected in bare-bones proceedings from filing petitions for habeas corpus, struck a strikingly different note. 
 justice samuel a. alito jr., writing for the five more conservative justices in the 7-to-2 decision, said asylum claims threatened to overwhelm the immigration system. congress was entitled to respond to that crisis, he wrote, by enacting a law that limited the role federal courts may play in reviewing summary determinations of whether asylum seekers faced a credible fear of persecution were they returned to their home countries. 
 in dissent, justice sonia sotomayor, joined by justice elena kagan, said the majority had damaged the rule of law. 
 “today’s decision handcuffs the judiciary’s ability to perform its constitutional duty to safeguard individual liberty and dismantles a critical component of the separation of powers,” justice sotomayor wrote. 
 the majority was unduly focused on “the burdens of affording robust judicial review of asylum decisions,” she wrote. “but our constitutional protections should not hinge on the vicissitudes of the political climate or bend to accommodate burdens on the judiciary.” 
 lee gelernt, a lawyer with the american civil liberties union, which represented the immigrant who brought the new case, said the trump administration’s immigration policies had made the need for judicial review more pressing. 
 “this law has been in existence since 1996,” he said, “but the need for judicial oversight has increased dramatically because the trump administration has so eviscerated the protections in the underlying asylum hearings.” 
 “this ruling fails to live up to the constitution’s bedrock principle that individuals deprived of their liberty have their day in court, and this includes asylum seekers,” mr. gelernt said. “this decision means that some people facing flawed deportation orders can be forcibly removed with no judicial oversight, putting their lives in grave danger.” 
 in a statement, the justice department called the decision “an important victory for enforcement of the immigration laws,” adding that it “allows the trump administration to continue to defend our borders, uphold the rule of law and keep americans safe.” 
 the case concerned vijayakumar thuraissigiam, a member of sri lanka’s tamil ethnic minority who was apprehended about 25 yards north of the mexican border near san ysidro, calif. 
 he sought asylum, saying he would face a credible fear of persecution if he were returned to sri lanka. his request was considered under “expedited removal” procedures called for by a 1996 law that streamlined asylum applications from people caught near the border and barred courts from reviewing most aspects of the determinations made under the procedures. 
 mr. thuraissigiam, a farmer, told an asylum officer that he had been savagely beaten in sri lanka by men who had blindfolded and abducted him. he said he had spent 11 days in a hospital recovering from his injuries. 
 though their communication was imperfect, an asylum officer believed mr. thuraissigiam. but the officer rejected his request because mr. thuraissigiam could not identify the assailants or definitively establish their motives. an immigration judge affirmed that determination. 
 mr. thuraissigiam filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, noting that what had happened to him was consistent with documented instances of abuses directed against tamils in sri lanka. a trial judge rejected the petition, saying it was barred by the 1996 law. 
 but a three-judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit, in san francisco, ruled the law unconstitutional, saying that it violated the constitution’s suspension clause. the clause says that “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.” 
 justice alito wrote that the clause did not cover claims like the one mr. thuraissigiam pressed. 
 “habeas has traditionally been a means to secure release from unlawful detention,” justice alito wrote, “but respondent invokes the writ to achieve an entirely different end, namely, to obtain additional administrative review of his asylum claim and ultimately to obtain authorization to stay in this country.” 
 “while respondent does not claim an entitlement to release, the government is happy to release him — provided the release occurs in the cabin of a plane bound for sri lanka,” he wrote. 
 in dissent, justice sotomayor questioned that analysis. 
 “respondent asks merely to be freed from wrongful executive custody,” she wrote. “he asserts that he has a credible fear of persecution, and asylum statutes authorize him to remain in the country if he does.” 
 justice alito also wrote that mr. thuraissigiam was not protected by the constitution’s due process clause even though he was apprehended within the united states. 
 “while aliens who have established connections in this country have due process rights in deportation proceedings,” he wrote, “the court long ago held that congress is entitled to set the conditions for an alien’s lawful entry into this country and that, as a result, an alien at the threshold of initial entry cannot claim any greater rights under the due process clause.” 
 in response, justice sotomayor questioned why the majority was addressing that issue at all. 
 “the court stretches to reach the issue whether a noncitizen like respondent is entitled to due process protections in relation to removal proceedings, which the court below mentioned only in a footnote and as an aside,” she wrote. 
 chief justice john g. roberts jr. and justices clarence thomas, neil m. gorsuch and brett m. kavanaugh joined justice alito’s majority opinion. 
 in a concurring opinion, justice stephen g. breyer, joined by justice ruth bader ginsburg, agreed that mr. thuraissigiam was not entitled to go to court to contest the rejection of his asylum claim. but he said the majority had gone much further than it should have. 
 “i would therefore avoid making statements about the suspension clause that sweep beyond the principles needed to decide this case — let alone come to conclusions about the due process clause, a distinct constitutional provision that is not directly at issue here,” justice breyer wrote. 
 the case, department of homeland security v. thuraissigiam, no. 19-161, was argued in early march and was among the last ones the justices heard in person before they stopped taking the bench because of concerns about the coronavirus. 
 on thursday, justice sotomayor acknowledged that “the asylum regime is under strain,” and she said congress and the president were in the best position to address the issue. 
 “the role of the judiciary is minimal, yet crucial: to ensure that laws passed by congress are consistent with the limits of the constitution,” she wrote, noting that the writ of habeas corpus was a crucial safeguard. “the court today ignores its obligation, going out of its way to restrict the scope of the great writ and the reach of the due process clause.”",439

 the technique hinges on the magic of the starchy cooking water, which is often added to pasta dishes to help the sauce come together. but here, the very water the pasta is cooked in seasons the noodles and becomes the velvety sauce. practically any pasta that cooks in 10 minutes or less works, but make sure to use the correct ratio of pasta to water. that’s the key to the dish’s success. 
 1. in a 12-inch skillet with high sides (you could use a pan of a different size, but cook times and water amounts will vary), melt 4 tablespoons butter or heat 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil over medium. add any ingredients that need to be cooked through, like garlic, hearty vegetables, sausage or bacon. (see the flavors section below for some ideas.) 
 2. once they’ve softened, add 12 ounces of pasta (make sure it will cook in 10 minutes or less — anything with a longer cook time will be unevenly cooked), along with 5 cups water and 2 teaspoons salt. if the noodles don’t lie flat in the skillet, break them in half. 
 3. turn the heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing the pasta constantly, until it is al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. if it looks dry, add water. season to taste with kosher salt and black pepper. remove from heat and serve. 
 with this formula, just about everything is adaptable: you can swap in all kinds of ingredients, change the cooking liquid and experiment with your noodles. 
 this recipe is an especially great way to stretch vegetables and meat, or to employ ingredients that need to be used up. add hearty vegetables and raw meats in step 1, and add quick-cooking ingredients, like shrimp or peas, in step 3 toward the end of cooking time. 
 swap out some or all of the water for broth, coconut milk or dashi. 
 if you want a creamier pasta, add another 1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream or whole milk toward the end. 
 you could also use udon, soba or ramen, but adjust the water and cook time. (it’s better to start with less liquid and add more if the pan looks dry.) use rice or another grain and you’ve got faux risotto. 
 if you’re stumped on how to experiment, try these combinations. consider each of these your first step, then pick up from step 2 in the recipe above. 
 broccoli and anchovy (above): cook anchovies and sliced garlic in olive oil, then add finely chopped broccoli and red-pepper flakes. 
 brown butter noodles: cook the butter until it smells toasty, and you see little browned bits. 
 alfredo: melt butter. sauté leeks or garlic until soft. add a parmesan rind. just before serving, add handfuls of grated parmesan and a little heavy cream. 
 hearty greens and chives: cook the stems of chard, kale or collard greens with the butter, then add thinly sliced leaves and whole chives. finish with lemon zest and juice (and maybe toasted bread crumbs). 
 cauliflower bolognese: melt butter and soften chopped garlic. add tomato paste and cook until it starts to stick to the bottom of the pot. add cauliflower rice, sliced onion and red-pepper flakes. 
 nori butter ramen: brown the butter, then add crumbled bits of nori and grated ginger. add ramen and frozen peas. finish with parsley, more nori, and lemon or lime.",11995

 on thursday, parliament passed the withdrawal agreement on which prime minister boris johnson successfully campaigned in last month’s general election. by the end of the month, it will be signed into law. the united kingdom will leave the european union on jan. 31. 
 for decades, membership in the european union helped glue together a fragmenting united kingdom; now brexit is tearing it apart. the short-lived fantasy of the “british nation,” too, may finally meet its end. 
 mr. johnson’s plan is likely to lead to a border between northern ireland and britain for the first time in modern history. the policy — designed to allow britain to radically break with europe while northern ireland remains aligned with the rest of the bloc, including the republic of ireland — is an astonishing betrayal of the ulster unionists, whose politics is predicated on the sanctity of the united kingdom. and drawing northern ireland into the same regulatory system as its southern neighbor poses a remarkable opportunity for the nationalists. a once-more united ireland is firmly in view. 
 that certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed in scotland. the pro-independence scottish national party, which took 48 of scotland’s 59 seats in december’s election, reads the writing on the wall. a large majority of scots voted to remain in the european union during the 2016 referendum; to allow northern ireland but not scotland to remain aligned with the european union’s market will only add to the sting. nicola sturgeon, the s.n.p.’s leader, has already formally requested that the scottish parliament be given powers to hold an independence referendum. mr. johnson, for his part, has made clear that he intends to stand in the way of such a vote, but he may not be able to block it forever. 
 so maybe this is the end. not this week, but perhaps by the end of the decade. first scotland, then northern ireland, leaving just england and wales, a mini-union, which itself could break up under pressure from welsh nationalists. 
 would that really be so bad? actually, it wouldn’t be. the breakup of the union certainly won’t be easy but it may be one of the few good things to come out of brexit — not just for scotland and ireland but also, and perhaps especially, for england. 
 after being released from the unionist grip, northern ireland could join a flourishing irish economy and a more socially liberal — how things have changed! — society. for the nationalists it will represent a long-desired reunion. although irish unity is what unionists most fear, they might now be able to reconcile themselves to their irishness after being betrayed by london. 
 scotland could take its own future in hand. it has a higher mortality rate than england, and while it is less unequal than its southern neighbor, the gap between them has narrowed over the past two decades. scots have put off dealing with these issues by putting the blame on london. independence will deprive them of that excuse and force them to face divisions in their own society. an independent scotland will come into its own political identity, rather than one premised just on contrasts. 
 and even england would benefit. despite its being the dominant nation in the united kingdom, the arrangement hasn’t been good for it. it doesn’t have a sense of itself as a nation to be transformed and is divided between the vibrant, youthful and pro-european big cities — especially london — and the aging, stagnating and anti-european rest of the country. 
 freed from the grip of the decayed british nation and british state, england could finally be done with its delusions of grandeur. fanciful beliefs about british importance in the world would crumble. england would be only around the eighth-largest economy in the world. and it would probably have to give up its nuclear weapons — the united kingdom’s nuclear submarine base is in scotland. 
 england need not be, as many fear, a rump united kingdom, parochial, perhaps even irredentist. less cocksure and more understanding of its real place in the world, it may soon rethink its hostility to the european union. scotland suffered a process of deindustrialization similar to northern england’s and wales’s — but it voted to remain. as the writer anthony barnett and others suggest, a progressive english nation, on the model of the scottish one, could emerge. this england might have an ordinary democratic nationalism that understands its own aspirations and those of others. 
 the idea of breaking up the union isn’t quite as outrageous as it might seem. the “united kingdom” is neither ancient nor stable. before 1945, “national” irish, welsh, scottish and english identities were for many not local varieties of national britishness but part of something much bigger: an imperial identity. 
 british world war ii propaganda explained that the united kingdom was just one equal element of a british commonwealth of nations that, along with india and the colonies, made up “the british empire.” it was the empire that fought the war, not the united kingdom. soldiers died for “king and country” — but that country had no name. no one died for “the united kingdom.” 
 after 1945, “britain” — a national united kingdom — was one of many post-imperial constructions that emerged from the ashes of the british empire. from then into the 1970s, the united kingdom existed as a coherent economic, political and ideological unit, distinct from the rest of the world. there was a national british economy, a national british army and a national british politics dominated by two national, unionist parties. it was a brief period of british nationhood. in fact, it was the only one. this national united kingdom was broken up economically starting in the 1970s by the closely related processes of globalization and deepening economic integration with europe. 
 it is this decaying british nationalism, a leftover from the 1970s, that is now disrupting the union, not the self-conscious scottish, irish and welsh versions. strong in england but weak elsewhere, with the exception of a handful of hard-core unionists in northern ireland, this british nationalism manifested itself in the calls for brexit, from before the 2016 referendum and up to today. the brexiteers wrongly believe that independence from the european union will make the united kingdom great again. 
 but brexit and the delusions of the united kingdom’s grandeur that go with it are the politics of the aged, of those who remember that brief experience of a united, national united kingdom. the young people of england, like those in the rest of britain, overwhelmingly supported remaining in the european union. they also understand we need liberation from the practices of westminster and whitehall, not brussels, and from the self-defeating rage of the old. 
 only a few decades ago, a new united kingdom emerged from the empire. now, by forcing the breakup of the union, the old — drinking deep the delusions of british nationalism — may make it possible for a new england to emerge from the united kingdom.

 that operation, in the middle of the american-led campaign against the islamic state in syria, showed the extent to which the united states military was willing to protect the syrian kurds, its main ally on the ground. 
 but now, with the white house revoking protection for these kurdish fighters, some of the special forces officers who battled alongside the kurds say they feel deep remorse at orders to abandon their allies. 
 [follow our live updates: assad’s army moves into a strategic border town.] 
 “they trusted us and we broke that trust,” one army officer who has worked alongside the kurds in northern syria said last week in a telephone interview. “it’s a stain on the american conscience.” 
 “i’m ashamed,” said another officer who had also served in northern syria. both officers spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals from their chains of command. 
 and the response from the kurds themselves was just as stark. “the worst thing in military logic and comrades in the trench is betrayal,” said shervan darwish, an official allied with the kurdish-led syrian democratic forces. 
 the next flurry of orders from washington, as some troops had feared, will pull american troops out of northern syria altogether. defense secretary mark t. esper said on sunday that president trump had ordered the roughly 1,000 american troops in the country’s northeast to conduct a “deliberate withdrawal” out of the country in the coming days and weeks. 
 the defense secretary’s statement came after comments on friday pushing back on complaints that the united states was betraying allies in syria — “we have not abandoned the kurds” — even as he acknowledged that his turkish counterpart had ignored his plea to stop the offensive. 
 army special forces soldiers — mostly members of the third special forces group — moved last week to consolidate their positions in the confines of their outposts miles away from the syrian border, a quiet withdrawal that all but confirmed the united states’ capitulation to the turkish military’s offensive to clear kurdish-held areas of northern syria.

 but as the americans pulled back, the kurds moved north to try to reinforce their comrades fighting the offensive. the american soldiers could only watch from their sandbag-lined walls. orders from washington were simple: hands off. let the kurds fight for themselves. 
 the orders contradicted the american military’s strategy in syria over the past four years, especially when it came to the kurdish fighters, known as the y.p.g., who were integral to routing the islamic state from northeastern syria. the kurds had fought in manbij, raqqa and deep into the euphrates river valley, hunting the last islamic state fighters in the group’s now-defunct physical caliphate. but the syrian democratic forces, or s.d.f., as the kurdish and their allied arab fighters on the ground are called, are being left behind. 
 american special forces and other troops had built close ties with their kurdish allies, living on the same dusty compounds, sharing meals and common dangers. they fought side by side, and helped evacuate kurdish dead and wounded from the battlefield. 
 “when they mourn, we mourn with them,” gen. joseph l. votel, a former head of the military’s central command, said on thursday at the middle east institute. 
 the kurdish forces and american military have survived previous strains, including mr. trump’s sudden decision in december to withdraw all american troops from northern syria, a decision that was later walked back somewhat. 
 this time may be different, and irreversible. “it would seem at this particular point, we’ve made it very, very hard for them to have a partnership relationship with us because of this recent policy decision,” general votel said. 
 as part of security measures the united states brokered to tamp down tensions with turkish troops, kurdish forces agreed to pull back from the border, destroy fortifications and return some heavy weapons — steps meant to show that they posed no threat to turkish territory, but that later made them more vulnerable when turkey launched its offensive. 
 special forces officers described another recent operation with kurds that underscored the tenacity of the group. the americans and the kurdish troops were searching for a low-level islamic state leader in northern syria. it was a difficult mission and unlikely they would find the commander. 
 from his operations center, one american officer watched the kurds work alongside the americans on the ground in an almost indistinguishable symmetry. they captured the islamic state fighter. 
 “the s.d.f.’s elite counterterrorism units are hardened veterans of the war against isis whom the u.s. has seen in action and trust completely,” said nicholas a. heras, a fellow at the center for a new american security, who visited the s.d.f. in july to advise them on the islamic state, or isis. 
 during the battle against isis, coordination between the united states military and the syrian democratic forces has extended from the highest levels to rank-and-file fighters, according to multiple interviews with s.d.f. fighters and commanders in syria over the course of the campaign. 
 s.d.f. commanders worked side by side with american military officers in a joint command center in a defunct cement factory near the northern syrian town of kobani, where they discussed strategy and planned future operations. 
 the battle of kobani that began in 2014 gave birth to the united states’ ties to the kurds in northeastern syria. isis fighters, armed with heavy american-made artillery captured from retreating iraqi army units, surrounded kobani, a kurdish city, and entered parts of it. 
 despite the obama administration’s initial reluctance to offer help, the united states carried out airstrikes against advancing isis militants, and its military aircraft dropped ammunition, small arms and medical supplies to replenish the kurdish combatants. 
 that aid helped turn the tide, the kurds defeated isis, and american commanders realized they had discovered a valuable ally in the fight against the terrorist group. 
 [sign up for the weekly at war newsletter to receive more stories about the american withdrawal from syria.] 
 thousands of s.d.f. fighters received training from the united states in battlefield tactics, reconnaissance and first aid. reconnaissance teams learned to identify islamic state locations and transmit them to the command center for the american-led military coalition to plan airstrikes. 
 visitors to front-line s.d.f. positions often saw syrian officers with ipads and laptops they used to communicate information to their american colleagues. 
 “for the last two years, the coordination was pretty deep,” said mutlu civiroglu, a washington-based kurdish affairs analyst who has spent time in northeastern syria. “the mutual trust was very high, the mutual confidence, because this collaboration brought enormous results.” 
 “they completed each other,” he said of the s.d.f. and united states-led coalition. “the coalition didn’t have boots on the ground and fighters didn’t have air support, so they needed each other.” 
 that coordination was critical in many of the big battles against the islamic state. 
 to open the battle in one town, s.d.f. fighters were deposited by coalition aircraft behind the islamic state’s lines. at the start of another battle, united states special operations forces helped the s.d.f. plot and execute an attack across the euphrates river. 
 even after the islamic state had lost most of its territory, the united states trained counterterrorism units to do tactical raids on isis hide-outs and provided them with intelligence needed to plan them. 
 even in territory far from the front lines with the islamic state, s.d.f. vehicles often drove before and after american convoys through syrian towns and s.d.f. fighters provided perimeter security at facilities where united states personnel were based. 
 the torturous part of america’s on-again, off-again alliance with the kurds — one in which the united states has routinely armed the kurds to fight various regimes it viewed as adversaries — emerged in 1974, as the kurds were rebelling against iraq. iran and the united states were allies, and the shah of iran and henry a. kissinger encouraged the kurdish rebellion against the iraqi government. c.i.a. agents were sent to the iraq-iran border to help the kurds. 
 the kurdish leader mustafa barzani did not trust the shah of iran but believed kissinger when he said that the kurds would receive help from the americans. 
 but a year later, the shah of iran made a deal with saddam hussein on the sidelines of an opec meeting: in return for some territorial adjustments along the iran-iraq border, the shah agreed to stop support for the kurds. 
 kissinger signed off on the plan, the iraqi military slaughtered thousands of kurds and the united states stood by. when questioned, kissinger delivered his now famous explanation: “covert action,” he said, “should not be confused with missionary work.” 
 in the fight against isis in syria, kurdish fighters followed their hard-fought triumph in kobani by liberating other kurdish towns. then the americans asked their newfound kurdish allies to go into arab areas, team up with local militias and reclaim those areas from the islamic state. 
 the american military implored the s.d.f. to fight in the arab areas, and so they advanced, seizing raqqa and deir al-zour, winning but suffering large numbers of casualties. 
 the american-kurdish military alliance against the islamic state in syria and iraq “began with us helping them,” said peter w. galbraith, the former american diplomat who has for years also been a senior adviser to the kurds in both syria and iraq. “but by the end, it was them helping us. they are the ones who recovered the territory that isis had taken.”",557
18.0,0.01680568794938242,0.7265999913215637,"official, russia, russian, intelligence, security, ukraine, report, department, government, agency","kiev, ukraine — to democrats who say that president trump’s decision to freeze $391 million in military aid was intended to bully ukraine’s leader into carrying out investigations for mr. trump’s political benefit, the president and his allies have had a simple response: there was no quid pro quo because the ukrainians did not know assistance had been blocked.  
 but then on tuesday, william b. taylor jr., the top united states diplomat in kiev, told house impeachment investigators that the freeze was directly linked to mr. trump’s demand. that did not deter the president, who on wednesday approvingly tweeted a quote by a congressional republican saying neither mr. taylor nor any other witness had “provided testimony that the ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld.”  
 in fact, word of the aid freeze had gotten to high-level ukrainian officials by the first week in august, according to interviews and documents obtained by the new york times. 
 the problem was not bureaucratic, the ukrainians were told. to address it, they were advised, they should reach out to mick mulvaney, the acting white house chief of staff, according to the interviews and records. 
 the timing of the communications, which have not previously been reported, shows that ukraine was aware the white house was holding up the funds weeks earlier than acknowledged.  
 it also means that the ukrainian government was aware of the freeze during most of the period in august when mr. trump’s personal lawyer rudolph w. giuliani and two american diplomats were pressing president volodymyr zelensky of ukraine to make a public commitment to the investigations. 
 the communications did not explicitly link the assistance freeze to the push by mr. trump and mr. giuliani for the investigations. but in the communications, officials from the united states and ukraine discuss the need to bring in the same senior aide to mr. zelensky who had been dealing with mr. giuliani about mr. trump’s demands for the investigations, signaling a possible link between the matters.  
 word of the aid freeze got to the ukrainians at a moment when mr. zelensky, who had taken office a little more than two months earlier after a campaign in which he promised to root out corruption and stand up to russia, was off balance and uncertain how to stabilize his country’s relationship with the united states. 
 days earlier, he had listened to mr. trump implore him on a half-hour call to pursue investigations touching on former vice president joseph r. biden jr. and a debunked conspiracy theory about ukrainian involvement in the 2016 hacking of the democratic national committee. mr. zelensky’s efforts to secure a visit to the white house — a symbolic affirmation of support he considered vital at a time when russia continued to menace ukraine’s eastern border — seemed to be stalled. american policy toward ukraine was being guided not by career professionals but by mr. giuliani. 
 mr. taylor testified to the impeachment investigators that he was told it was only on the sidelines of a sept. 1 meeting between mr. zelensky and vice president mike pence in warsaw that the ukrainians were directly informed by gordon d. sondland, the united states ambassador to the european union, that the aid would be dependent on mr. zelensky giving mr. trump something he wanted: an investigation into burisma, the company that had employed mr. biden’s younger son, hunter biden. 
 american and ukrainian officials have asserted that ukraine learned that the aid had been held up only around the time it became public through a news article at the end of august.  
 the aid freeze is drawing additional scrutiny from the impeachment investigators on wednesday as they question laura k. cooper, a deputy assistant defense secretary for russia, ukraine and eurasia. this month, democrats subpoenaed both the defense department and the white house office of management and budget for records related to the assistance freeze. 
 as mr. taylor’s testimony suggests, the ukrainians did not confront the trump administration about the freeze until they were told in september that it was linked to the demand for the investigations. the ukrainians appear to have initially been hopeful that the problem could be resolved quietly and were reluctant to risk a public clash at a delicate time in relations between the two nations. 
 the disclosure that the ukrainians knew of the freeze by early august corroborates, and provides additional details about, a claim made by a c.i.a. officer in his whistle-blower complaint that prompted the impeachment inquiry by house democrats. 
 “as of early august, i heard from u.s. officials that some ukrainian officials were aware that u.s. aid might be in jeopardy, but i do not know how or when they learned of it,” the anonymous whistle-blower wrote. the complainant said that he learned that the instruction to freeze the assistance “had come directly from the president,” and said it “might have a connection with the overall effort to pressure ukrainian leadership.” 
 publicly, mr. zelensky has insisted he felt no pressure to pursue the investigations sought by mr. trump. 
 “there was no blackmail,” mr. zelensky said at a news conference this month. he cited as evidence that he “had no idea the military aid was held up” at the time of his july 25 call with mr. trump, when mr. trump pressed him for investigations into the bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory about ukrainian involvement in the hacking of the democratic national committee in 2016. 
 mr. zelensky has said he knew about the holdup of the military aid before his meeting in poland on sept. 1 with mr. pence, but has been vague about exactly when he learned about it. “when i did find out, i raised it with pence at a meeting in warsaw,” he said this month. 
 in conversations over several days in early august, a pentagon official discussed the assistance freeze directly with a ukrainian government official, according to records and interviews. the pentagon official suggested that mr. mulvaney had been pushing for the assistance to be withheld, and urged the ukrainians to reach out to him. 
 the pentagon official described mr. mulvaney’s motivations only in broad terms but made clear that the same ukrainian official, andriy yermak, who had been negotiating with mr. giuliani over the investigations and a white house visit being sought by mr. zelensky should also reach out to mr. mulvaney over the hold on military aid.  
 a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak publicly about the issue said on monday that mr. mulvaney “had absolutely no communication with the ukranians about this issue.” 
 ukrainian officials had grown suspicious that the assistance was in jeopardy because formal talks with the pentagon on its release had concluded by june without any apparent problem. 
 in talks during the spring with american officials, the ukrainians had resolved conditions for the release of the assistance, and believed everything was on schedule, according to ivanna klympush-tsintsadze, ukraine’s former vice prime minister for euro-atlantic integration. 
 but by early august, the ukrainians were struggling to get clear answers from their american contacts about the status of the assistance, according to american officials familiar with the ukrainians’ efforts. 
 in the days and weeks after top ukrainian officials were alerted to the aid freeze, mr.  sondland and kurt d. volker, then the state department’s special envoy to ukraine, were working with mr. giuliani to draft a statement for mr. zelensky to deliver that would commit him to pursuing the investigations, according to text messages between the men turned over to the house impeachment investigators. 
 the text messages between mr. volker, mr. sondland and the top zelensky aide did not mention the holdup of the aid. it was only in september, after the warsaw meeting, that mr. taylor wrote in a text message to mr. sondland, “i think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.” 
 after being informed on sept. 1 in warsaw that the aid would be released only if mr. zelensky agreed to the investigations, ukrainian officials, including their national security adviser and defense minister, were troubled by their inability to get answers to questions about the freeze from united states officials, mr. taylor testified.  
 through the summer, mr. zelensky had been noncommittal about the demands from mr. volker, mr. sondland and mr. giuliani for a public commitment to the investigations. on sept. 5, mr. taylor testified, mr. zelensky met in kiev with senators ron johnson, republican of wisconsin, and christopher s. murphy, democrat of connecticut.  
 mr. zelensky’s first question, mr. taylor said, was about the security aid. the senators responded, mr. taylor said, that mr. zelensky “should not jeopardize bipartisan support by getting drawn into u.s. domestic politics.” 
 but mr. sondland was still pressing for a commitment from mr. zelensky, and was pressing him to do a cnn interview in which he would talk about pursuing the investigations sought by mr. trump.  
 mr. zelensky never did the interview and never made the public commitment sought by the white house, although a ukrainian prosecutor later said he would “audit” a case involving the owner of the company that paid hunter biden as a board member.  
 mr. giuliani has said he had nothing to do with the assistance freeze and did not talk to mr. trump or “anybody in the government” about it. “i didn’t know about it until i read about it in the newspaper,” he said in an interview last week.",3054
35.0,0.01537976208770422,0.8654999732971191,"vaccine, dose, johnson, vaccination, health, agency, receive, federal, administration, government","washington — workers at a plant in baltimore manufacturing two coronavirus vaccines accidentally conflated the ingredients several weeks ago, contaminating up to 15 million doses of johnson & johnson’s vaccine and forcing regulators to delay authorization of the plant’s production lines. 
 the plant is run by emergent biosolutions, a manufacturing partner to both johnson & johnson and astrazeneca, the british-swedish company whose vaccine has yet to be authorized for use in the united states. federal officials attributed the mistake to human error. 
 the mix-up has delayed future shipments of johnson & johnson doses in the united states while the food and drug administration investigates what occurred. johnson & johnson has moved to strengthen its control over emergent biosolutions’ work to avoid additional quality lapses. 
 the mistake is a major embarrassment both for johnson & johnson, whose one-dose vaccine has been credited with speeding up the national immunization program, and for emergent, its subcontractor, which has faced fierce criticism for its heavy lobbying for federal contracts, especially for the government’s emergency health stockpile. 
 the error does not affect any johnson & johnson doses that are currently being delivered and used nationwide, including the shipments that states are counting on next week. all those doses were produced in the netherlands, where operations have been fully approved by federal regulators. 
 further shipments of the johnson & johnson vaccine — expected to total 24 million doses in the next month — were supposed to come from the giant plant in baltimore. those deliveries are now in question while the quality control issues are sorted out, according to people familiar with the matter. 
 federal officials still expect to have enough doses from johnson & johnson and the other two approved coronavirus vaccine makers to meet president biden’s commitment to provide enough vaccine to immunize every adult by the end of may. 
 pfizer is shipping its doses ahead of schedule, and moderna is on the verge of winning approval to deliver vials of vaccine packed with up to 15 doses instead of 10, further bolstering the nation’s stock. 
 the problems arose in a new plant that the federal government enlisted last year to produce vaccines from johnson & johnson and astrazeneca. the two vaccines use the same technology employing a harmless version of a virus — known as a vector — that is transmitted into cells to make a protein that then stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. but johnson and johnson’s and astrazeneca’s vectors are biologically different and not interchangeable. 
 in late february, one or more workers somehow confused the two during the production process, raising questions about training and supervision. in the past year, emergent has hired and trained hundreds of new workers to produce millions of doses of both vaccines that were supposed to be ready by the time clinical trials showed whether the vaccines actually worked. 
 vaccine production is a notoriously fickle science, and errors are often expected to occur and ruin batches. but emergent’s mistake went undiscovered for days until johnson & johnson’s quality control checks uncovered it, according to people familiar with the situation. by then, up to 15 million doses had been contaminated, the people said. 
 none of the doses ever left the plant, and the lot has been quarantined. there is no indication that production of astrazeneca’s vaccine, which has yet to be authorized for emergency use by the food and drug administration, was affected. 
 johnson & johnson reported the mishap to federal regulators, who then started an investigation that has delayed the authorization of that plant’s production lines. the company has beefed up the number of its own staff members who monitor emergent’s work and instituted a variety of new checks intended to protect against future lapses. 
 johnson & johnson already faced a lag in its manufacturing that has caused the company to fall behind on its commitments to the federal government, but it seemed on track to catch up. it delivered 20 million doses by the end of march, and has pledged to deliver about another roughly 75 million doses by the end of may. 
 white house officials hedged their projections in a phone call with governors on tuesday, forecasting certain deliveries from pfizer and moderna but warning that johnson & johnson’s shipments would fluctuate. 
 in a statement late wednesday, the company said it expected the steps it was now taking with emergent would enable it to deliver 24 million doses by the end of april, or about what the federal government expected. but that depends on whether johnson & johnson satisfies food and drug administration regulators. 
 the agency last week cleared a bottling facility that johnson & johnson uses in indiana, allowing the release of more doses made in the netherlands. but that facility cannot send out doses produced in the emergent plant until the food and drug administration authorizes it. 
 nearly seven million doses of the vaccine have been delivered so far, and about half of those have been administered, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.

 a blunder with paperwork seems to have been the problem: british airways said a german company that had chartered the plane, wdl aviation, had submitted the wrong route to air traffic controllers. 
 “we are working with wdl aviation, who operated this flight on behalf of british airways, to establish why the incorrect flight plan was filed,” british airways said in a statement. 
 the flight, ba3271, which took off from london city airport, did not seem to have been in any danger; because of the incorrect paperwork, the crew — including the pilot — and air traffic controllers had all apparently believed that edinburgh was the plane’s intended destination. 
 that came as small comfort to the passengers when flight attendants informed them that they had landed in the scottish capital, about 520 miles from their intended destination. 
 “british airways, can you please explain how can my morning flight taking off from lcy to düsseldorf land in edinburgh?” one passenger, son tran, wrote on twitter, using the airport code for london city airport. 
 mr. tran, who was going to düsseldorf on business, said that none of the passengers had seemed aware of the destination mix-up. 
 “while an interesting concept, i don’t think anyone on board has signed up for this mystery travel lottery,” he added in his post. 
 british airways said, “we have apologized to customers for this interruption to their journey and will be contacting them all individually.” 
 london city airport also apologized, saying on twitter, “as pleasant as edinburgh is this time of year, we’re sorry that passengers traveling to düsseldorf on ba3271, operated by wdl aviation, initially landed in the scottish capital.” 
 in an emailed statement, wdl aviation said it was “working closely with the authorities to investigate how the obviously unfortunate mix-up of flight schedules could occur.”

 in manhattan’s flagging real estate market, that was the median sale price of a two-bedroom apartment last quarter — an 8 percent drop from the same period last year, and the largest discount among studio to three-bedroom co-ops and condos, according to the brokerage douglas elliman. only the four-bedroom-and-up market fell further, with a 17 percent drop. 
 after years of softness at the top, it is finally becoming a buyers’ market for people who intend to actually live and work in new york. case in point: deep bargains across the wide spectrum of two-bedrooms, the most common apartment for sale in the city.  
 manhattan’s two-bedroom market had the largest discount among studio to three-bedroom co-ops and condos last quarter. 
 source: douglas elliman 
 by the new york times 
 yes, prices are still out of reach for many new yorkers, but there are increasing options for first-time and move-up buyers at far lower prices than the median sales price suggests. coupled with historically low interest rates, two-bedroom buyers are stretching their dollars further with everything from income-restricted co-ops to shiny new condos. 
 since the city’s real estate sales market peaked around 2016, observers have focused on the shrinking price tags of ultraluxury three- and four-bedroom apartments, thousands of which remain vacant and unsold. the causes are many: investor speculation, oversupply, shrinking tax breaks, rising transfer taxes, economic uncertainty and downright hubris. 
 the current declining prices in smaller apartments, though, represents a significant shift and the return of more reasonable pricing. two-bedrooms made up 31.5 percent of manhattan’s for-sale inventory last quarter, the most of any category, according to the elliman report, and has long been the bread-and-butter of both developers and agents. the two-bedroom market accounted for half of all sales at one point in the 1990s, but in more recent years, the ultraluxury condo boom in manhattan has prompted a move to bigger and more lavish apartments — many of which were targeted to investors and second-home buyers, said jonathan miller, the president of miller samuel real estate appraisers & consultants and author of the report. 
 still, upgrading from a smaller apartment to a two-bedroom remains cost prohibitive for many new yorkers, mr. miller said. last quarter, it cost a median $685,000 more to move up from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom in manhattan. 
 those forces — too expensive for many move-up buyers, too small for the affluent jet set — have squeezed the two-bedroom market into an awkward position for many sellers, said tyler whitman, an agent with triplemint and cast member on the reality series “million dollar listing.” 
 “twenty-five hundred options in the city is a lot of options,” he said, referring to an estimate of how many two-bedrooms are listed in manhattan. owners of standard cookie-cutter two-bedrooms would face the toughest challenge, he said. 
 of course, the lower prices may be discounts without distinction for many new yorkers. the median household income in manhattan was $79,781 in 2017. assuming a 20 percent down payment and spending 35 percent of their monthly income on a mortgage and additional housing costs, such a buyer could comfortably afford a $358,896 apartment, according to streeteasy. citywide, the household income was $57,782, enough for a $259,933 home.  
 to highlight potential bargains across the extensive two-bedroom market, we looked at income-restricted units for first-time buyers, prewar co-ops with deep discounts, new condos with back-end sweeteners, and options beyond manhattan.

 prewar bargains 
 many look to the glut of new high-rise, luxury condos for what ails the city’s real estate market, but ambitious pricing at the top also set unrealistic expectations in the comparatively modest co-op market. 
 “sooner or later what was happening in the luxury market was likely to catch up with the two-bed market,” said frederick warburg peters, the chief executive of warburg realty, who added that one-beds and small two-bedrooms have “sunk into the doldrums” since about four months ago. 
 compared to the same period in the previous year, the median price of co-ops declined for the first time in 13 straight quarters, according to the elliman report. 
 frances katzen, an agent with douglas elliman, recently listed in sutton place, on the east side of manhattan, a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with plenty of natural light and prewar bona fides for $599,000 — a 20 percent markdown from its previous price of $750,000. two years ago, it listed and languished on the market with another brokerage for $995,000. 
 “people are cannibalizing each other, to usurp a buyer from one another,” said ms. katzen, who believes the true value of the apartment is around $625,000 — but she listed lower in the hopes of standing out from a growing number of co-ops for sale.  
 the biggest discounts for two-bedroom resale apartments were downtown, south of 14th street, where the median sales price fell 15 percent to $1,568,750 compared to the same quarter last year, according to the brokerage halstead. midtown had the second deepest discount for resales in that period, a 10 percent drop to $1,217,500.

 income-restricted 
 even among apartments specifically reserved for middle-income buyers in housing development fund corporation co-ops, prices have softened. 
 in upper manhattan’s hamilton heights, allison jaffe and linda mancini listed in october a $325,000 two-bedroom, one-bath apartment, 24 percent less than when it was listed earlier this year for $430,000 with another brokerage. 
 because the apartment is in an h.f.d.c. co-op, there are income limits for buyers (up to $57,600 for a family of two, $67,200 for three or more), as well as restrictions at resale designed to keep the unit affordable. 
 “the phone’s been ringing every day,” said ms. mancini, who is an agent with key real estate services. so far they have had about 18 showings and six offers, she said. 
 the lower price was well advised. upper manhattan just had the fewest third-quarter sales of co-ops and condos in a decade, said mr. miller, the appraiser, in part because of a surge of new expensive inventory and ambitious resale pricing that followed. 
 one of the difficulties with h.d.f.c co-ops is that the income caps can leave buyers little room to save for a down payment. but with the price cut, they hope to have expanded the buyer pool for their listing, ms. jaffe said. 
 the city has about 28,500 h.d.f.c. units across 1,333 buildings, according to the department of housing preservation and development. but there were only 230 income-restricted apartments listed for sale in the five boroughs as of late october, according to streeteasy.

 beyond manhattan 
 two-bedrooms need not be million-dollar investments in new york, especially outside of manhattan. in the kingsbridge heights section of the bronx, daniel d’amico of damico group real estate, is listing an 878-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in a 2006 condo for $349,000. 
 “what we’re seeing right now, in the bronx at least, is the market is super hot,” mr. d’amico said. “if it’s priced right, it’s going to sell in the first week or so.” the apartment was listed in late september and already has an accepted offer, he said. 
 while sales volume is down across the city and prices are down in manhattan, prices have been steadily rising in the other boroughs. in queens, the number of sales dropped 7 percent compared to the same period last year, but the median sales price rose to $600,000, a record since at least 2003, according to a douglas elliman report. in brooklyn, despite rising inventory and falling prices in the luxury segment, co-ops sold for a median $485,000, a new third-quarter record. 
 none of the major brokerages release boroughwide sales reports for the bronx, the most affordable borough in the city, but its perception is changing, with a major development boom underway and a growing share of market-rate housing for sale.

 new development 
 some of the most attractive deals for two-bedrooms can be found in new buildings, and for good reason: a glut of empty luxury condos. about 4,100 of 16,200 condo units completed since 2013, roughly one in four, remained unsold in september, according to an analysis of streeteasy data. 
 developers are loathe to lower their prices directly, in part because of obligations to lenders and for fear of devaluing the rest of their stock. instead, buyers are getting discounts on the back end. 
 in east harlem, patricia weber, a bio-tech start-up consultant, recently closed on a two-bedroom apartment at 1399 park, a new 23-story condo tower, for $995,000. that was, ostensibly, the full asking price, but ms. weber’s agent, rob taub with core, also negotiated that the developer pay for her transfer taxes, a discount of about $25,000. 
 ms. weber, who is moving from bucks county, pa., had been considering a new york purchase for a decade, but only started looking in earnest six months ago. there was no shortage of choices, she said, but she and her husband liked the east harlem building because of its attended lobby, its proximity to transit, and the neighborhood’s culture and restaurants. she will use the second bedroom as an office, because she works remotely. 
 the price is also notable, because it falls just short of triggering the so-called “mansion tax” on the purchase price of homes over $1 million. in july, the flat 1 percent tax was changed to a staggered rate of 1.25 percent for $2 million sales, and up to 3.9 percent above $25 million. 
 the changes spurred many buyers to close their purchases before the summer deadline, and as a result the pace of sales in the latest quarter plummeted, especially for larger, more expensive apartments. but the two-bedroom market was also affected, in part because they can cost well above $2 million, and even those below the new tax threshold suffered from negative market sentiment, agents said. 
 “i think, potentially, we’re near the bottom of the market for everything,” said shaun osher, the chief executive of core.

 elsewhere, new projects are offering far more than closing cost rebates. at one manhattan square, a new 815-unit skyscraper south of chinatown, the developer extell recently offered to pay for seven years of common charges on the purchase of a two-bedroom apartment. two-beds make up about 40 percent of the inventory and prices for those now start around $2.1 million, which would mean more than $100,000 of forgiven common charges, paid for by the developer. 
 that promotion is no longer being offered, said raizy haas, a senior vice president with extell, but “the truth is, we’re reasonable.” the developer is now testing a rarely seen model in luxury condos: rent-to-own plans, in which a tenant can apply the rent toward the purchase of the unit. 
 as of oct 24., there were 209 closed sales at the building, or about a quarter of the total inventory, according to an updated streeteasy analysis. ms. haas said there were “hundreds more that have not yet closed.” 
 how a discount is derived can vary, but increasingly, it’s becoming the rule in new development, said mr. peters of warburg realty. 
 “there’s practically nowhere where you can’t negotiate the price, and the transfer taxes, and the mansion tax, and the legal fees, and who knows what else,” he said. where to draw the line in the sand is another thing. 
 “i can’t count how many times i’ve heard a client say ‘o.k., if i drop the price, can you guarantee me a quick sale?’ and my response is no,” he said. “all i can guarantee you is no sale, if you don’t.”

 america isn’t making electricity the way it did two decades ago:  natural gas has edged out coal as the country’s leading generation source … 
 … and renewables like wind and solar have made small yet speedy gains. but, each state has its own story. 
 in nevada, natural gas surpassed coal as the top source of electricity generation in 2005, earlier than in many other states. coal’s role in the state’s power mix has continued to decline since then. 
 in iowa, wind power has taken off over the past decade. it now makes up nearly 40 percent of the electricity produced in the state. 
 but in west virginia, coal still fuels nearly all electricity generation. 
 overall, fossil fuels still dominate electricity generation in the united states. but the shift from coal to natural gas has helped to lower carbon dioxide emissions and other pollution. last year, coal was the main source of electricity generation for 18 states, down from 32 states in 2001. 
 but experts warn that a shift to natural gas alone won’t be enough to curb emissions and avoid dangerous global warming. 
 “switching from coal to gas is a fine thing to do in the short run, but it’s not a solution in the longer run,” said severin borenstein, director of the energy institute at the university of california, berkeley’s haas school of business. “gas still produces a lot of greenhouse gases. we can’t stay on gas and solve this problem. ultimately we’re going to have to go to much lower or zero-carbon sources.” 
 we charted every state’s electricity generation mix between 2001 and 2017 using data from the united states energy information administration. scroll down or skip to your state: 
  
 in 2001, coal fueled more than half of the electricity produced in alabama, but several of the state’s aging coal plants have closed since then or transitioned to burning cheaper natural gas. by 2017, natural gas was the top electricity source in the state, followed by nuclear. coal came in third place, providing just under a quarter of the state’s power generation. 
 alabama generates more electricity than it consumes, and typically sends about one-third of its output to nearby states. 
 natural gas has been alaska’s top source of electricity generation since 2001, but hydroelectric power has increased its share during that time. the state aims to get 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, but that goal is voluntary and has no legal weight. 
 alaska has its own electric grid, which means that “whatever electricity is created there is what they’re consuming,” said glenn mcgrath, a power systems analyst at the energy information administration.  “it’s about as isolated as you can get.” 
 many of alaska’s rural communities are not connected to the main grid at all and use diesel generators for power. 
 coal was arizona’s top source of electricity generation until 2016, when natural gas produced more power. last year, natural gas, nuclear and coal each provided a little less than a third of the electricity produced in the state. 
 but coal power is expected to decline further. the state’s navajo generating station, the largest coal-fired power plant in the west, is slated to close in 2019, largely because of competition from cheaper natural gas. 
 arizona supplies electricity throughout the southwest. the state has abundant solar potential and will require utilities to get 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. in november, voters rejected a ballot initiative that would have raised that target to a more ambitious 50 percent by 2035. 
 coal was the top source of electricity produced in arkansas every year between 2001 and 2017, but its generation share slowly decreased during that time. natural gas, meanwhile, grew to provide more than a quarter of the electricity produced in the state last year, up from just 6 percent in 2001. 
 arkansas generates more electricity than it consumes and exports power to nearby states. 
 natural gas has been california’s top electricity source since 2001. but half of the power produced in the state last year came from renewable sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectricity. 
 hydroelectric power, which dwindled between 2014 and 2015 because of drought, rose again last year to provide the largest share of renewable generation in the state. solar power has grown quickly over the past five years, largely because of state policies like an aggressive renewable energy standard. this year, california commited to get all of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. 
 last year, about a fourth of the electricity consumed in the state, including some generated by coal power, came from outside of its borders. (imports are not pictured in the graphic above.) but california plans to stop buying electricity from coal-burning plants in utah and other states. 
 the vast majority of the electricity generated in colorado comes from fossil fuel sources: about half from coal, and a quarter from natural gas. but wind power has been on the rise over the past decade. last year, wind was the third-largest source of electricity produced in colorado, accounting for nearly a fifth of the state’s generation. 
 colorado has set a requirement that 30 percent of the electricity sold by utilities come from renewable sources by 2020. 
 nuclear power and natural gas supplied the vast majority of electricity generated in connecticut between 2001 and 2017. natural gas power has been on the rise during that time, accounting for nearly half of the state’s electricity generation last year, up from just 13 percent nearly two decades earlier. coal-fired generation has almost entirely disappeared in the state and connecticut’s last remaining coal plant, bridgeport harbor, is scheduled to close in 2021. 
 five percent of the electricity generated in connecticut came from renewable sources in 2017. this year, the state expanded its renewable energy standard to require that utilities get 40 percent of the electricity they sell to consumers from renewable sources by 2030. 
 natural gas displaced coal as the primary source of electricity produced in delaware in 2010, and coal’s generation share has declined dramatically since then. coal provided 70 percent of the power produced in delaware in 2008, its peak year, but slightly less than 5 percent by 2017. natural gas more than quadrupled its generation share during the same period. 
 thanks in part to this shift, carbon dioxide emissions from the state’s electricity sector have fallen over the past decade. delaware will require that utilities get 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. 
 power produced in the state supplies “between two-thirds and three-fourths of the electricity sold to delaware customers,” according to the e.i.a. the rest comes from neighboring states through the regional grid. (imports are not shown in the chart above.) 
 in 2001, more than a third of the electricity produced in florida came from burning coal, but natural gas surpassed coal as the state’s top generation source two years later and continued to expand its share of the state’s power mix. by 2017, natural gas made up two thirds of florida’s electricity generation, more than double the national average. 
 florida is the second-largest producer of electricity nationwide, after texas, but still relies on imports  from neighboring states to meet consumer demand. 
 despite its nickname, the sunshine state generates very little power through solar energy and has no renewable energy requirements. 
 coal provided the majority of georgia’s power generation through the 2000s but declined as natural gas power increased. in recent years, coal’s generation share has dropped sharply as several aging coal-fired plants have been retired. 
 utilities in the state are in the process of building two new nuclear reactors, the only new nuclear projects under construction in the country. 
 about a tenth of georgia’s power generation came from renewable sources last year, mostly biomass and hydroelectricity. but solar power is growing quickly in the state. georgia doesn’t impose any statewide renewable energy requirements, but the city of atlanta is developing a plan to get all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035. 
 hawaii has relied heavily on imported petroleum to make electricity for the past two decades. but the state has a bold plan to generate all of its power from local renewable sources by 2045. 
 last year, renewables accounted for a fourth of the power produced in hawaii, up from less than a tenth in 2001. solar generation, mostly from small-scale rooftop panels, has grown rapidly in the state over the past five years. 
 hydroelectric power has long dominated idaho’s generation mix. but, in recent years, its share has fallen, partly because of drought. the state still produces the majority of its electricity from renewable sources, with wind powering 15 percent of in-state generation last year, up from less than 2 percent a decade ago. solar power, while still a small share, increased sharply between 2016 and 2017. 
 idaho relies heavily on out of state imports to meet electricity demand. while coal makes up only a fraction of in-state generation, in the end “about one-third of the electricity consumed in idaho is from coal-fired power plants located in other states,” according to the e.i.a. (import data is not shown in the chart above.) 
 nuclear power is illinois’ top source of electric generation. it has provided more than half of the power produced in the state for nearly two decades. coal is an important source of power for the state, too  – even surpassing nuclear as the top generation source twice over the past decade, in 2004 and again in 2008 – but its share has declined in recent years as old power plants have been retired or converted to burn natural gas. both natural gas and wind power have increased over the past decade. 
 illinois produces “considerably more” electricity than it uses in-state, according to the e.i.a. it sends the surplus to mid-atlantic and midwestern states through regional grids. 
 coal has generated most of the electricity made in indiana for nearly two decades, but, in recent years, natural gas and wind power have made inroads. natural gas accounted for 2 percent of the state’s electricity generation in 2001 but grew to provide nearly 20 percent in 2017. 
 the indiana legislature established a voluntary clean energy standard in 2011 that encourages electric utilities to get an increasing amount of power from renewable and other alternative energy sources. however, no indiana utilities participated in the program last year, according to the e.i.a. 
 wind power has exploded in iowa over the past decade. wind provided just 1 percent of the electricity produced in the state in 2001 but climbed to nearly 40 percent by 2017. iowa still produces nearly half its electricity from coal, but coal’s generation share has declined since 2010. 
 in absolute terms, the state, one of the windiest in the country, was the third-largest producer of wind power last year, after texas and oklahoma. iowa produces more power than it consumes, sending the surplus to nearby states. 
 iowa in 1983 became the first state to pass legislation requiring utilities to get some amount of electricity from renewable resources, but the state has not updated its standards. 
 like many great plains states, kansas has seen significant growth in wind power over the past decade. the share of electricity generated from wind has increased fivefold since 2010. 
 in 2009, the kansas legislature passed a renewable energy standard requiring utilities to get an increasing amount of electricity from wind, solar and other renewable sources – up to 20 percent by 2020. but gov. sam brownback and state legislators softened the measure in 2015, making the goal voluntary, after conservative groups with ties to the industrial conglomerate koch industries lobbied against the stricter standard. 
 coal still powers the vast majority of the electricity produced in kentucky, a longtime coal mining state. last year, coal was the source of nearly 80 percent of state generation, but for most of the past two decades that number hovered closer to 90 percent. 
 since 2014, a number of kentucky’s older coal plants have been shut down or converted to burn natural gas, which provided 13 percent of the state’s electricity generation in 2017. 
 natural gas provides the bulk of electricity generation in louisiana, one of the top-five producers of natural gas in the country. last year, gas accounted for 60 percent of electricity made in the state, up from 46 percent in 2001. during that time, coal-fired generation declined, dropping from its position as the second-biggest source of power in the state to third place. 
 louisiana also gets some electricity from neighboring states. (imports are not in the chart above.) 
 maine “leads new england in wind power generation,” according to the e.i.a. last year, wind supplied  one-fifth of the electricity produced in the state. hydroelectric and biomass power, which comes from burning wood and other organic material, were the next-biggest sources of generation. 
 since 2000, the state has required that electricity providers get 30 percent of the power they sell to customers from existing renewable resources. in 2017, utilities were expected to get 10 percent from new renewable sources. the state has separate goals for wind-energy development. 
 the total amount of electricity created in maine has declined since 2010, especially from natural gas power, and the state has increasingly relied on energy imports from canada. (imports are not included in the chart above.) 
 coal power has been on the decline in maryland for a decade and has provided less than half of the electricity produced in the state since 2012. during that time, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power and natural gas has increased. 
 solar power generation, while still small, has grown quickly over the past several years. since 2004, the state has required that an increasing amount of the electricity sold by utilities come from renewable sources, with a target of 25 percent by 2020. 
 maryland consumes more electricity than it generates and imports nearly half of its power from other mid-atlantic states through the regional grid. (imports are not included in the chart above.) 
 natural gas has more than doubled its share of electricity generation in massachusetts over the past two decades. coal and oil generation fell sharply during that same period, and the state’s last large coal-fired power plant shut down last year. the amount of power created from solar energy has increased sharply in the state since 2013. 
 this year, the state toughened its mandate for utilities to sell electricity from renewable sources, raising the requirement to 35 percent of total sales by 2030. the new legislation also encourages offshore wind development. 
 massachusetts consumes more electricity than it produces in-state and gets the remainder from nearby states through the regional grid. (imports are not shown in the chart above). 
 coal remained the top source of electricity produced in michigan last year, but its generation share declined from a little over 60 percent in 2001 to just under 40 percent in 2017. during the same period, natural gas nearly doubled its generation share. wind, michigan’s main renewable energy source, provided nearly 5 percent of the electricity produced in the state last year. 
 in 2008, michigan required utilities and other electricity providers to get at least 10 percent of the power they sell to customer from renewable sources by 2015. that goal was met and subsequently expanded to 15 percent by 2021. 
 coal has been the top source of electricity generated in minnesota for the past two decades. but coal’s generation share declined between 2001 and 2017 as wind and natural gas generation grew. 
 the state requires utilities to gradually sell an increasing amount of electricity from renewable sources, with a requirement of 25 percent of total sales by 2025. 
 natural gas powered more than three-quarters of the electricity generated in mississippi last year. coal, once the state’s top source of electricity, has declined over the past decade, outcompeted by cheaper natural gas. coal provided 36 percent of the electricity produced in-state in 2001, but just 8 percent in 2017. 
 missouri’s electricity generation mix hasn’t changed much in nearly two decades. coal provided the vast majority of power generated in the state between 2001 and 2017, declining only slightly during that time as older coal-fired plants went offline or switched to burning natural gas. 
 missouri will require utilities to get at least 15 percent of the electricity they sell from renewable sources by 2021, including a small amount from solar power. 
 coal has been the top source of electricity produced in montana for nearly two decades but its generation share declined from 70 percent in 2001 to just under 50 percent last year. hydropower, the state’s second-largest source of electricity, increased its share during that time to nearly 40 percent, and wind power grew to 8 percent of in-state generation. 
 montanans only use about half of the electricity produced in the state, according to the e.i.a. the state sends the rest to its western neighbors. 
 coal has been the top source of electricity produced in nebraska for nearly two decades, but its generation share declined slightly between 2001 and 2017. nuclear power provided 25 percent of the state’s electricity generation on average during that time, but its share varied from year to year. 
 wind has been increasing its share of total generation over the past decade, accounting for 15 percent of the electricity produced in the state last year. nebraska has the potential for substantially more wind power, according to the e.i.a. 
 natural gas edged out coal as nevada’s top electricity generation source in 2005. the state’s largest coal plant, the mohave generating station, went offline at the end of that year, further shrinking coal’s role in the state’s power mix. more nevada coal generators have shuttered since then because of competition from cheap natural gas and state laws that require renewable energy development. 
 last year, natural gas provided nearly 70 percent of electricity produced in the state, followed by solar power, which supplied 12 percent of the state’s generation. until recently, nevada required that 25 percent of the electricity sold by utilities in the state come from renewable sources by 2025. in november, nevadans voted to increase that requirement to 50 percent by 2030. 
 the bulk of electricity generated in new hampshire comes from the seabrook nuclear power plant, the largest reactor in new england. natural gas has provided about a fifth of the power produced in the state since the early 2000s, when two new generating stations began operating. the share of new hampshire’s electricity generated from coal has dwindled over the past two decades, from 25 percent in 2001 to less than 2 percent in 2017. 
 the state is requiring utilities to get 25 percent of the electricity they sell to customers from renewable resources by 2025. the top two sources of renewable energy in the state are biomass, or energy that comes from burning wood and other organic matter, and hydroelectric power. 
 new hampshire produces more power than is consumed in-state and sends  about half to neighboring states through new england’s regional electric grid. (exports are not included in the chart above.) 
 nuclear power was the top source of electricity generated in new jersey until recently, when it was edged out by natural gas. last year, natural gas accounted for nearly half of the state’s power generation, and nuclear power supplied 45 percent. solar energy contributed 4 percent of the state’s electricity. 
 this year, new jersey increased its renewable energy standard to require that 21 percent of the electricity sold in the state come from renewable sources by 2021, with that requirement increasing to 35 percent by 2025 and to 50 percent by 2030. in an effort  to further reduce carbon emissions, the state also passed legislation to prop up its nuclear plants, which currently provide the largest portion of zero-emissions energy. 
 the state gets some of the power it consumes through the mid-atlantic regional grid. (imports are not included in the chart above.) 
 coal has been new mexico’s primary source of electricity generation for nearly two decades. but coal-fired power declined since 2004 “in response to tougher air quality regulations, cheaper natural gas, and california’s decision in 2014 to stop purchasing electricity generated from coal” in neighboring states, according to the e.i.a. 
 natural gas, wind and solar accounted for a little less than half of the electricity produced in new mexico last year, up from just 15 percent two decades earlier. the state will require utilities to get 20 percent of the electricity they sell from renewable energy by 2020. new mexico is also looking to increase generation from zero-carbon sources because it sends a significant amount power to california, a state with some of the strictest renewable energy policies in the country. 
 natural gas and nuclear power have supplied the majority of electricity generated in new york for nearly two decades and their share has expanded as coal use in the state has declined. for the past decade, new york has also produced about a fifth of its electricity from hydropower, the state’s largest source of renewable energy. 
 the state will require utilities to get 50 percent of the power they sell to consumers from renewable sources by 2030, an ambitious goal, and aims to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  wind and solar energy make up a small but growing portion of new york’s electricity generation, together providing just over 4 percent of the state’s electricity last year. 
 new york tends to consume more energy than it creates and imports some electricity from neighboring states and canada. (electricity imports are not included in the chart above.) 
 coal provided the majority of north carolina’s electricity generation between 2001 and 2011. but nearly 30 of the state’s coal-burning units shut down over the following six years and, by 2017, coal generation had dropped below nuclear and natural gas power. natural gas generation increased after the national fracking boom of the late 2000s and became the second-largest source of electricity generation in the state in 2016. 
 north carolina is currently the only southern state with significant solar generation. the state’s unique implementation of a decades-old federal mandate, the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978, has encouraged the growth of utility-scale solar. north carolina has also set a requirement that utilities get 12.5 percent of the electricity they sell to consumers from renewable energy resources by 2021. 
 as in many great plains states, wind energy has taken off in north dakota over the past decade. last year, wind powered more than a quarter of the electricity produced in the state, up from less than 2 percent a decade earlier. 
 in 2007, the north dakota legislature set a voluntary goal for utilities: to get 10 percent of the electricity sold to consumers from renewable or recycled energy by 2015. that goal was met and even surpassed, according to utility analysts. 
 north dakota produces more electricity than is consumed in the state and about half is sent to its neighbors. (exports are not charted above.) 
 coal has been the top source of electricity produced in ohio for nearly two decades but its generation share has been decreasing since 2011 as several of the state’s coal-fired power plants have closed down. over that same period, natural gas has increased its share in ohio’s electric generation mix. 
 wind is currently the state’s top source of renewable energy, though it provided only about 1 percent of the electricity generated in ohio last year. the state wants to expand that, however. it will require utilities to get at least 12.5 percent of the electricity they sell to consumers from renewable sources by the end of 2026. 
 the bulk of oklahoma’s power generation for much of the past two decades has come from natural gas and coal, with the two often competing to be the state’s top source of electricity. but in 2016, wind surpassed coal as the second-largest source of electricity produced in the state. 
 last year, the state was second only to texas in total electricity generation from wind. 
 in 2010, oklahoma required that 15 percent of its generation capacity comes from renewable sources by 2015. it also designated natural gas as its preferred choice for new fossil fuel projects. the state had exceeded the renewable target by 2012. 
 most of the electricity produced in oregon in any given year comes from hydropower but the share produced from water fluctuates with precipitation. power from natural gas typically increases during drought years, and decreases in years with ample hydroelectricity. 
 over the past decade, wind power has grown to become the third-largest source of electricity generated in the state. in an effort to encourage more non-hydroelectric renewable energy, oregon will require its largest utilities to get 50 percent of the electricity they sell from new renewable energy sources by 2040. the program covers projects introduced or upgraded since 1995, a cutoff that would exclude older hydropower. 
 coal powered the bulk of electricity produced in pennsylvania through 2014, when it fell below nuclear for the first time. coal’s generation share in the state decreased after the late-2000s fracking boom as aging coal power plants closed because of competition from cheaper natural gas. 
 last year, nuclear power was the top source of electricity generated in pennsylvania. but natural gas is putting economic pressure on the state’s nuclear generators, too, with one reactor scheduled to shut down in 2019. pro-nuclear groups, saying the loss of this emissions-free electricity is bad news for climate change, have sought state subsidies for nuclear energy. 
 pennsylvania will require that 18 percent of the electricity that utilities sell to consumers come from renewable and alternative energy by 2021, with at least 0.5 percent coming from solar power. last year, renewable energy made up about 5 percent of in-state generation. 
 pennsylvania is the country’s third-biggest generator of electricity, behind texas and florida. the state is a big supplier of energy to the mid-atlantic region. 
 natural gas dominates electricity generation in rhode island, but wind and solar energy, while still small, have grown quickly in recent years. 
 rhode island will require electricity providers to get nearly two-fifths of the power they sell to consumers from renewable sources by 2035. the state consumes more electricity than it generates and gets the rest from neighboring states. (imports are not included in the chart above.) 
 a majority of the electricity generated in south carolina comes from nuclear power, with coal and natural gas taking second and third place, respectively. coal’s generation share has declined over the past decade as power from natural gas has increased. 
 south carolina produces more power than it consumes and sends the surplus to neighboring states. 
 hydropower has supplied the majority of the electricity created in south dakota for most of the past two decades, but coal generation surpassed hydroelectricity during three years: 2001, 2004 and 2008. since then, coal’s share of the state generation mix has declined, while the share coming from wind power has increased. 
 last year, wind was the second-largest source of electricity produced in south dakota, accounting for nearly a third of generation in the state. 
 south dakota exports power to states across the central and western united states. 
 coal supplied most of the electricity produced in tennessee between 2001 and 2016, but its generation share started to decline about a decade ago as natural gas power gained share. last year, coal-powered generation dipped below nuclear for the first time in nearly two decades. 
 tennessee consumes more power than it produces and makes up the shortfall with electricity from nearby states. (imports are not included in the chart above.) 
 texas produces more electricity than any other state, and natural gas has been its top generation source since 2001, with coal in second place. but coal’s generation share has declined as wind power has increased. in 2014, wind overtook nuclear power as the third-largest source of electricity produced in the state. texas produces more power from wind in total than any other state, with oklahoma and iowa in second and third place. 
 texas adopted a renewable energy requirement in 1999 , requiring the state to install 10,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2025. it has already reached that goal. 
 the majority of electricity produced in utah comes from coal, but coal’s share has declined over the last several years as natural gas has increased. 
 the state produces more energy than it consumes and sends the surplus to nearby states like california. at least one utah power plant is switching from burning coal to natural gas to comply with california’s stricter environmental regulations. 
 solar power grew to become the largest renewable generation source in the state in 2016 and expanded its share again last year. utah has set a goal for utilities to get 20 percent of the electricity they sell from renewable sources by 2025. 
 most of the electricity generated in vermont came from nuclear power until 2014, when the state’s only nuclear plant, the vermont yankee station, closed down. since then, nearly all of the electricity produced in the state has come from renewable sources, including hydropower, biomass, wind and solar. but, vermont’s absolute generation capacity has substantially declined. 
 vermont imports most of its electricity from nearby states and canada. last year, the state’s own generation “provided only about two-fifths of the electricity consumed in vermont,” according to e.i.a. 
 vermont’s ambitious renewable energy goal requires that 75 percent of electricity sold in the state come from renewable sources by 2032, including 10 percent from small, in-state sources. 
 coal was the top source of electricity produced in virginia between 2001 and 2008, when its share began to decline. natural gas power increased in the state following the national fracking boom of the late 2000s and took over as the state’s primary generation source in 2015. nuclear generation has provided a little more than a third of virginia’s electricity, on average, over the past two decades. 
 virginia consumes more electricity that it generates, so it gets additional power from nearby states through the mid-atlantic regional grid. the state has established a voluntary goal for utilities to get 15 percent of the electricity they sell from renewable sources by 2025. 
 hydropower has supplied a majority of the electricity created in washington every year since 2001, but its share of state generation has fluctuated with precipitation. coal, natural gas, nuclear and wind power have alternated as the second-largest source of electricity produced in the state for most of the past two decades. 
 washington produces more electricity than it consumes and exports power to canada and other western states. the state will require its larger utilities to get 15 percent of their electricity sales from new renewable sources by 2020. 
 coal dominates west virginia’s power generation mix, supplying more than 90 percent of the electricity produced in the state every year for nearly two decades. hydropower provided a small portion of in-state generation between 2001 and 2017. wind and natural gas have increased their generation share in recent years, but each of those sources only accounted for about 2 percent of electricity created in the state last year. 
 after years of lobbying by conservative groups, west virginia became the first state to repeal its renewable energy standard in 2015. the law would have required utilities to get 25 percent of their electricity from alternative and renewable energy sources by 2025. opponents of the standard said it was hurting coal jobs and raising electricity rates, while supporters said it would help to diversify the state’s electric sector at a time when the national coal market was in decline. 
 west virginia generates more electricity than it consumes and supplies about half of its power to other mid-atlantic states through the shared regional grid. (exports are not pictured in the chart above.) 
 most of the electricity produced in wisconsin comes from coal, but natural gas generation has increased over the past three years. wind power established a foothold in the state a decade ago and has slowly expanded its share of electricity generation, too. 
 wisconsin required its utilities to get 10 percent of the electricity sold in the state from renewable sources by the end of 2015. that goal was surpassed two years ahead of schedule. 
 the vast majority of electricity generated in wyoming comes from coal, but wind power has made inroads during the past decade. last year, wind provided nearly a tenth of the electricity produced in the state. 
 because of its small population, wyoming produces much more power than it consumes and sends about 60 percent to nearby states.",1740

 but jackson’s swift rise took a humbling pause on monday night when patrick mahomes, his counterpart on the kansas city chiefs, showed why he remains the face of the league and the most electrifying player in the game. 
 in a display of athleticism, creativity and poise, mahomes and the chiefs dismantled jackson’s ravens — the league’s top-ranked defense — in a 34-20 victory that was more lopsided than the final score indicated. 
 the chiefs struck quickly and often in the first half, with mahomes throwing screen passes to the rookie running back clyde edwards-helaire, long touchdowns to the speedy receivers tyreek hill and mecole hardman, and numerous passes in the middle of the field to tight end travis kelce. for good measure, he ran for a touchdown as well. 
 and when the ravens took advantage of two chiefs turnovers in the second half to pull within a touchdown, mahomes rebooted the chiefs’ offense to put the game out of reach. in the process, he set an n.f.l. record by surpassing 10,000 yards passing for his career in the fewest games, breaking kurt warner’s record. 
 “the sky’s the limit for this kid,” chiefs wide receiver sammy watkins said. “he’s a rare breed of talent.” 
 even after winning the league’s m.v.p. in 2018, and the same honor when the chiefs in the super bowl in february, mahomes continues to amaze. he threw one of his signature no-look passes. he shoveled an underhand touchdown pass to his fullback. he ran for first downs to extend drives. he lofted 40-yard passes with baltimore’s blitzing linebackers bearing down on him. and to seal the game, he threw a 2-yard score to one of his offensive linemen, eric fisher. 
 in all, mahomes completed 31 of 42 passes for 385 yards and four touchdowns. by rushing for his team’s first score, he ensured he had a direct hand in all five kansas city touchdowns. 
 in the process, mahomes turned what was supposed to be a showdown between two of the league’s best teams led by two of the league’s best quarterbacks into another reminder of how far he is ahead of his peers. 
 “you have to take your hat off to patrick mahomes,” ravens defensive end calais campbell said. “right now, they play like the best team in the league.” 
 mahomes has now beaten jackson in all three of their head-to-head matchups since 2018. in his young career as a starting quarterback, jackson is now 0-3 against the chiefs and 21-1 against every other team in the league during the regular season. it was the ravens’ first regular-season loss in a year. 
 “our kryptonite,” jackson said after yet another loss to mahomes and the chiefs. 
 at times, it is hard to fathom that mahomes just turned 25 this month. after winning the super bowl in february, he signed a 10-year contract worth as much as $500 million. in june, he was one of several star players who made a video calling on the n.f.l. to acknowledge that black lives matter. after he received his super bowl ring, he got engaged. for good measure, he bought a stake in the kansas city royals. 
 considering the result of monday’s game, it was remarkable that the chiefs were 3.5-point underdogs coming into it. afterward, several chiefs players took to social media to mock the oddsmakers. 
 the matchup was billed as a potential preview of the a.f.c. championship game in january. under the new playoff format this season, only the top seeded team will earn a bye in the first round of the playoffs. now, the chiefs already hold the tiebreaker if they and the ravens wind up tying with the conference’s best record. 
 in the first half on monday, the chiefs used their full complement of talent. mahomes spread the ball around, doling out touches to edwards-helaire and to kelce, his trusted tight end. the chiefs went up, 27-10, with less than three minutes left in the first half. the ravens’ lone touchdown in the half came on a 93-yard kickoff return. 
 for much of the game, the ravens looked flustered. jackson ran for 83 yards but ended up with a career-low (at least as a starter) 97 yards passing. he had only 15 completions, and only one touchdown pass. his receivers didn’t help. jackson missed a certain touchdown throw to start the third quarter when the usually sure-handed tight end mark andrews couldn’t pull in one of jackson’s passes. 
 still, the ravens crept closer to the chiefs after taking advantage of two miscues — a fumble that led to a field goal midway through the third quarter, and a defensive stop on fourth down that gave them the ball at midfield. on the resulting drive, jackson took the ravens down the field and hit tight end nick boyle for a score that cut the chiefs’ lead to 27-20 heading into the fourth quarter. 
 but mahomes brought the chiefs right back, throwing his final touchdown pass to fisher, an offensive tackle who lined up as an eligible receiver. as mahomes jogged off the field, he counted to four with the fingers on his right hand to signify how many touchdown passes he had thrown.",10129

 then, as the nose of lion air flight 610 repeatedly bucked downward, harvino, the co-pilot, began to pray. 
 the supplication was caught on the final seconds of audio in the cockpit voice recorder. 
 “god is great,” mr. harvino, an experienced indonesian aviator, said, then recited a verse asking god to grant a miracle. 
 but there was no miracle on oct. 29, when the brand-new boeing 737 max 8 dived into the java sea in indonesia, amid good weather, after 12 minutes in the air. 
 “i think he knew it was unrecoverable,” said nurcahyo utomo, the head of the air accident subcommittee of the indonesian national transportation safety committee, who listened to and described the contents of the cockpit voice recorder that was retrieved from the ocean floor in january. 
 [how the u.s. joined other nations in grounding the boeing plane.] 
 until that point, he said, the pilots had sounded in control and calm. 
 how the pilots of lion air flight 610 lost control. 
 with the crash of a second nearly brand-new boeing 737 max 8 this month, when ethiopian airlines flight 302 slammed into the ground near addis ababa, there has been a renewed focus on the investigation into what caused flight 610 to crash in indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. 
 indonesian transportation officials say they do not expect to publish a final report on the accident until july or august at the earliest. a preliminary report, based on the contents of the flight data recorder — one of the two so-called black boxes that give investigators clues to what happened in aviation accidents — was released in november. 
 the cockpit voice recorder was not found until after the preliminary report was released, so the conversations between bhavye suneja, an indian national who was piloting the plane, and mr. harvino were not included in the initial investigative account. 
 the report noted that the plane’s nose suddenly shifted downward more than 20 times, a motion that investigators think may have been caused by the incorrect triggering of a new automated anti-stall system on the boeing max model. 
 since the lion air crash, pilots certified to fly the max have complained that they were not briefed on the new system or on how to counter it should incorrect data force the nose down. 
 indonesian aviation regulations bar the public release of a transcript of the audio in a cockpit voice recorder. but investigators from the national transportation safety committee who listened to the recording described the sounds emanating from the cockpit as the flight crew fought to take control of a plane that seemed almost magnetically propelled toward earth. 
 throughout the brief flight, an ominous rattle could be heard on the voice recorder, evidence that a device called a stick shaker was clattering to alert the pilots of a potential stall that could lead to a crash, said ony soerjo wibowo, an air safety investigator. a stall can occur when a plane ascends too sharply. 
 transcript 
 it was sold as a next generation aircraft. but it has now been involved in two fatal crashes in just five months. the boeing 737 max 8 entered the market in 2017, a part of the 737 max class, and became an instant hit. within the first six months, more than 4,000 boeing 737 max 8 planes had been ordered. it quickly became the company’s best-selling plane ever. the new model was advertised as a rare win-win for both airlines and passengers. “it’s going to give them max efficiency, which leads to profitability; max reliability, and to the flying public: max passenger appeal.” ‘the demand for something new.” boeing debuted the new planes in response to market pressures. in late 2010, boeing’s archrival, airbus, had just announced a new fuel-efficient version of its best selling a320. boeing countered with the introduction of the 737 max — “the max uses 14 percent less fuel than current 737s —” its own version of fuel- and cost- efficient aircrafts. their message to customers was: these are new planes that aren’t that new. “boeing 737 —” “newest arrival in the boeing family of airliners, the 737 attracts a crowd.” boeing’s first 737 model took off in 1967. “a new queen of the sky.” for the max class, boeing upgraded the engine and design. they added more cabin space, bigger windows and multicolored ceiling lights to help modernize the planes. but the company kept the 737 name because it evoked a legacy of reliability and built trust. “i’ll tell you what, it’s just a beautiful, beautiful airplane. not only were they able to modernize the airplane with new engines, and new winglets, but they were able to keep that classic iconic 737 look.” but that isn’t the whole story. the new model was also designed to help carriers save money. “which means ceos like the max. really like the max.” major changes to the plane would have required pilots to be retrained. but boeing’s position was that the new models handled enough like the old ones. though the 737 max 8 planes did actually have a number of changes, including the size and location of the engines. the higher and more forward position of the larger engines can cause the plane’s nose to pitch up, a potential danger. to compensate for this, boeing added a computerized system called mcas to prevent the plane’s nose from getting too high and causing a stall. but the f.a.a. initially said pilots did not need to be informed of this system update. experts say that the lack of training for the new system may have helped cause a deadly crash with a max 8 off the coast of indonesia in october, killing 189 people. all of the boeing 737 max 8s in the world are believed to have been grounded, while a second crash in ethiopia is investigated. boeing said it supported the decision to ground the planes and is cooperating with investigators. 
 [read more on why the 737 that crashed is boeing’s best-selling plane ever.] 
 investigators have speculated that incorrect data — including a 20-degree differential between readings from two sensors designed to measure, essentially, the difference between the pitch of the plane and the direction it is moving through the air — could have mistakenly triggered both the stick shaker and the anti-stall system, which is called mcas. 
 the plane had recorded days of questionable data related to air speed, altitude and the angle of the plane’s climb. 
 in the first sign of trouble in its doomed flight on oct. 29, the plane dipped around 700 feet, and in the subsequent minutes, mcas appears to have kept dragging the plane’s nose down, prompting the pilots to try to push the plane back up by using switches that control stabilizers on the tail. 
 the flight crew radioed back to the air traffic control tower in jakarta, the indonesian capital, to request permission to return to the airport, which was granted. the pilot also asked for the plane to be given a 3,000-foot clearance above and below as it continued to roller coaster through the air. 
 flight 610 never turned back to the airport. 
 in the cockpit voice recording, the pilots discussed unreliable airspeed and altitude readings they were getting, national transportation safety officials said. 
 they consulted the manual to deal with these anomalies. but they did not seem to know about the mcas system, nor did they speak about what was causing the plane to repeatedly push downward. 
 shortly after mr. harvino’s prayer, the plane disappeared from radar, and the cockpit voice recorder stopped. the plane plummeted 5,000 feet, crashing into the java sea with such force that parts of the fuselage turned into powder. 
 mr. harvino’s remains are missing to this day.",11969

 two astronomers recently went looking for a monster black hole. they sifted reams of data from the most powerful telescopes on and above earth for any sign of an invisible object hundreds of times the mass of the sun in a distant cloud of stars known as ngc 6397. 
 instead, they found a nest of baby monsters, as many as five dozen: dark engines of annihilation, packed into a space barely larger than our own solar system, buzzing back and forth and throwing their considerable weight around in the dense core of the star cluster. 
 eduardo vitral and gary a. mamon of the paris institute of astrophysics, using data from the hubble space telescope and the european space agency’s gaia spacecraft, reported their results on feb. 11 in the journal astronomy and astrophysics. 
 “we found very strong evidence for an invisible mass in the dense core of the globular cluster,” mr. vitral, a graduate student, said in a news release from the space telescope science institute. “but we were surprised to find that this extra mass is not ‘point-like.’” 
 the surprise result has given astronomers a unique and detailed look at the dynamics prevailing inside one of the most crowded places in the nearby cosmos. their work suggests that such clusters are a likely source of the gravitational waves that have been detected by antennas like ligo and virgo in recent years, and that originate from colliding black holes. 
 but the discovery raises questions about the presumed and confusing process by which small black holes, only a few times as massive as the sun, can merge and grow into behemoths that dominate the centers of galaxies and that power distant quasars. 
 black holes, as predicted by albert einstein’s theory of general relativity, are objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape them. their existence was once doubted, but astronomers now agree that the universe is speckled with them, like potholes in space-time. most are dead stars that collapsed on themselves and disappeared after burning up all their thermonuclear fuel, with masses only a few times that of the sun. 
 but there are other black holes, with masses of millions or billions of suns, sitting in the centers of galaxies. there seems to be a correlation between the size of a galaxy and the mass of the black hole in its heart, but nobody knows why or how such large holes are formed. 
 one idea is that these supermassive black holes grew from smaller, stellar-size black holes, in which case there should be black holes of intermediate masses — hundreds or thousands of suns worth — floating about, perhaps in the cores of smaller galaxies or galaxy fragments like ngc 6397. but so far these intermediate black holes are missing in action. 
 the cluster ngc 6397 is one of about 150 spherical clouds of ancient stars that orbit the milky way and perhaps predate its formation. it is 13 billion years old and contains about 250,000 stars, all of them old, small and dim. the brighter, heavier stars in the cluster long ago burned through their lives and met their fate as black holes or other products of stellar decay. 
 so the cluster is a likely candidate to harbor an intermediate-mass black hole. indeed, earlier studies had suggested that a black hole of about 600 solar masses anchored the center of ngc 6397. 
 to investigate that idea, dr. mamon and his student turned to high-resolution observations of the motions of individual stars in the cluster, obtained by the hubble space telescope and gaia. the faster the stars were moving, the greater the gravitational force, and hence more mass, must be present to hold them in the cluster. 
 in all, 1,905 stars from the gaia catalog and 7,209 stars from hubble were appraised. as it turned out, they were indeed under the gravitational influence of an invisible mass. but rather than tightly circling a single dark point, the stars were moving every which way, suggesting that whatever dark mass was influencing them was not concentrated, but extended. there was no sign of a gargantuan black hole. 
 “our analysis indicated that the orbits of the stars are close to random throughout the globular cluster, rather than systematically circular or very elongated,” dr. mamon said in an email. 
 the motions of those stars offered evidence of a dark mass equal to 1,800 suns spread across a region — a cloud within the cloud — about one-third of a light-year wide. sharing that space are some 40,000 ordinary, luminous but very lightweight stars. according to models of stellar evolution, dr. mamon said, about two-thirds of this dark stuff would be black holes, with an average mass of 20 suns. the rest of the dark material would be remnants of dead stars, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. 
 what will happen next is not clear, the astronomers said. random mergers between the black holes could cause them to lose mass in the form of gravitational waves. such mergers could also propel some black holes out of the cluster. and gravitational interactions with less massive stars in the cluster could cause them to lose speed and sink to the center of the cluster, in a process called “dynamical friction.” 
 “this may bring the black holes to the center in a few million years, where they merge into an intermediate-mass black hole,” dr. mamon said. 
 but that window of time is nothing compared with the 13 billion years that the cluster has existed, dr. mamon noted, so it would be “lucky,” to say the least, if astronomers had happened to focus on the cluster at the exact moment that this brief action was taking place. the fact that there is not an intermediate-mass black hole there by now suggests that one may never form. the sinking of the black holes toward the center may cease as the black holes encounter too few stars to exchange energy with, and “this would prevent the formation of an i.m.b.h.,” he said. 
 mr. vitral added: “our discovery of this invisible concentration in a core-collapse globular cluster is surely something that makes us wonder about many ideas of intermediate-mass black hole formation!”

 when a video of naomi campbell cleaning her airplane seat and wearing a mask and gloves was shared online last year, it made the rounds because her behavior seemed exaggerated. (“clean everything you touch,” ms. campbell said in the video.) 
 major airlines, including delta air lines and american airlines, say they clean their planes to varying degrees between flights, and that plane cleanliness is a priority. but some travelers, including apparently ms. campbell, prefer the comfort of knowing they’ve also taken measures of their own to sanitize their airplane space. 
 there’s been increased attention on this in recent weeks, with the unsettling spread of the coronavirus around the world. 
 “the airplane and airplane seat is a public space, and we know that germs can live on surfaces for a long time, so it doesn’t hurt to clean it,” said aaron milstone, associate hospital epidemiologist at the johns hopkins hospital. 
 here are some tips for cleaning your area of a plane and keeping healthy on a flight. 
 “wiping down surfaces on a plane won’t hurt, as long as it doesn’t give you a false sense of security,” andrew mehle, associate professor of medical microbiology and immunology at the university of wisconsin madison, said, stressing that sanitizing your space on a plane should be done in conjunction with washing hands and following other best practices. 
 viral particles, the transmission vehicle of the coronavirus, must travel within mucus or saliva, and they must enter through eyes, nose or mouth. while the coronavirus can last on surfaces like tray tables, touch screens, door handles and faucets — one study found that other coronaviruses, like sars and mers stay on metal, glass and plastic for up to nine days — a disinfectant on a hard surface, or soap while washing your hands, will kill the virus. 
 however, most people tend to touch their faces more often than they realize. doing so after touching a surface where there are droplets from when someone sneezed or coughed can lead to the virus being passed on. 
 so first things first: wash your hands. 
 “it’s just as important to think about where your hands have been and to wash your hands,” said dr. mehle. 
 wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or long enough to sing “happy birthday” twice, and if that’s not possible, then use a generous amount of hand sanitizer. 
 a study from emory university found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window. researchers studied passengers and crew members on 10 three- to five-hour flights and observed that people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. 
 “book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,” said vicki stover hertzberg, a professor at emory university’s school of nursing and director of the center for nursing data science at emory, and one of the lead researchers on the study. “be vigilant about your hand hygiene.” 
 when you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down too. using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. 
 “it’s not bad to wipe down the area around you, but it’s worth remembering that the coronavirus is not going to jump off the seat and get into your mouth,” dr. milstone said. “people should be more careful of touching something dirty then putting their hands on their faces.” 
 disinfecting wipes typically say on the packaging how long a surface needs to stay wet in order for them to work. that time can range from 30 seconds to a few minutes. in order for the wipes to work, you need to follow those time requirements. 
 dr. hertzberg added that if there’s a touch-screen television, you should use a tissue when touching the screen. using a paper towel or tissue ensures that there’s a barrier between a surface that might have droplets and your hands, which will likely make their way to your face. 
 “someone who has been sick and coughing might have touched the door and the faucet, so use wipes in the bathroom then use paper towels to open the door and to close the faucet then throw those in the trash on the way out,” said bernard camins, the medical director for infection prevention at the mount sinai health system.",14121

 at the official u.s. level, jared kushner has spent three years ginning up a peace plan that he still won’t show anyone. so far, his only achievement is an israeli-palestinian economic conference in bahrain that no israeli or palestinian officials attended.  
 kushner actually seems to believe that the problem can be solved by the israelis and gulf arabs funding a leveraged buyout of palestinian aspirations for sovereignty and statehood. 
 kushner deserves some credit for fresh thinking about how to attract investment to the west bank, but he lapsed into magical thinking when he allowed all the diplomatic features of his plan to be dictated by the political needs and desires of prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel. 
 the reason his plan has not been released yet is that it does not serve bibi’s election needs. even though it reportedly offers the palestinians only some diluted form of autonomy in the west bank and arab districts of jerusalem, any new powers for them are a nonstarter right now for netanyahu, who needs every right-wing settler vote he can muster to win re-election on sept. 17. 
 president trump says he will release kushner’s plan after the israeli election, but i would not trust that for a second. trump’s only participation in this process has been to exploit it by being slavishly pro-bibi to win political donations from sheldon adelson and votes from jews in florida. if bibi doesn’t want kushner’s plan released, it won’t be. 
 but let me not pick on kushner. if kushner has no palestinian partner for his leveraged buyout plan, mainstream democrats have no israeli partner for their golden oldie — the “two-state solution.” they pretend that netanyahu is a partner for a two-state solution, even though bibi’s been openly, gradually but steadily moving israel toward annexation of the west bank. 
 israel and its allies on capitol hill have even stymied an attempt by some democratic and republican senators to pass a mild resolution in the senate saying a two-state solution should still be on the table. 
 but let me not be too hard on the democrats — the american center left — because the israeli center left has no plan on the table, either. the main israeli center-left party, called blue and white, is not running on a platform that even acknowledges the principle of two states for two people: israelis and palestinians. it fears looking naïve to israelis and losing right-of-center votes. 
 talk about reality denial, the most existential question in israel — what to do with the 2.5 million palestinians in the west bank — is not on the september ballot. 
 then again, one should not come down too hard on the american and israeli center lefts since the palestinians also have not put any detailed two-state peace plan on the table, and, even if they did, they no longer have a single governing authority to negotiate for them and definitively end the conflict with israel. the palestinians are divided between an islamist hamas-led government in gaza and the more secular palestinian authority in the west bank. and both are teetering on failed-state status. 
 not to be outdone in magical thinking or performance art, the progressive democratic far-left contingents in the u.s. congress, and on college campuses, and in europe, also have no plan. they have an attitude. it’s often expressed in support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. if you go to its website, b.d.s. specifically states that it “does not advocate for a particular solution to the conflict and does not call for either a ‘one state solution’ or a ‘two state solution.’” 
 b.d.s. does, though, specifically call for a boycott of israel until it stops “its occupation and colonization of all arab lands,” but it’s vague on whether that is just the west bank and east jerusalem or all of israel. it also demands the return of all palestinian refugees and their descendants since the 1948 war — not to a future west bank palestinian state but to their original villages in what is now israel — while making no mention of the rights of the jews to a state in their historical homeland.  
 as such, the pro-b.d.s. progressives — who do not distinguish between boycotting israeli products from occupied territories and boycotting the idea of a jewish state — have no plan or real israeli partner. 
 so there you have it. we have peace plans with no partners and movements with no peace plans. 
 the only hope i see is for the emergence of an israeli leader ready to boldly make a unilateral — but coordinated — separation from the west bank in the way that ariel sharon made a unilateral — but uncoordinated — withdrawal from the gaza strip in 2005. in a unilateral separation, the israeli army would retain overall security control of the west bank but cede much more day-to-day economic control and political control to palestinians, and curb jewish settlement deep in the west bank. 
 there are currently about 105,000 jewish settlers now living deep inside the west bank, right in the heart of where any palestinian state in a two-state solution would be located. that is, they are living beyond the west bank settlement blocks, where another 300,000 jewish settlers live but would remain in any peace deal.  
 if that settlement process deep inside the west bank is not halted immediately — and incentives created for those settlers to move — there will be no hope ever for a two-states-for-two-people peace deal. the only option left will be one state for two people, a recipe for permanent strife. 
 so, israelis and palestinians don’t just need a plan for peace now, they need a plan to save a plan for peace. that’s how bad things are. 
 the only israeli leader powerful enough to provide that right now is netanyahu, but he is focused only on saving himself from indictment on corruption charges. could benny gantz, the former israeli army chief of staff and the leader of the blue and white party, be that person if he defeats netanyahu? i hope. he has the potential. 
 i am reading a smart and prescient new book related to all of this, titled “be strong and of good courage: how israel’s most important leaders shaped its destiny,” by veteran u.s. peace negotiator dennis ross and analyst david makovsky. i asked ross what was the key difference between israel’s leaders then and now. 
 “as much as israel’s founding leaders may have disagreed with one another, men like david ben-gurion and menachem begin always in the end put the interests of the state above their own,” said ross. “they understood that whether you were making a choice or doing nothing, you were making a choice.” 
 two quotes in this book stand out. one comes from begin, the right-wing prime minister, after he was criticized by fellow israeli religious-nationalists for offering a plan for palestinian autonomy in december 1977 to anwar el-sadat. begin told his critics that his proposal demonstrated “decency” and that israel could not ethically control land without granting rights. israel, begin added, would never “be like rhodesia,” then an apartheid state. 
 the other quote is from sharon, who once remarked to ross when asked about his big decision to unilaterally withdraw from gaza in 2005: “my generation is the last one that is not afraid to make big decisions. i fear that the next generation will be led by politicians and they won’t decide.” 
 let’s hope that sharon’s prediction was wrong. otherwise, begin’s rhodesia fears will come true.

 the ruling said that the church should be welcoming toward gay people, “with respect and sensitivity,” but not endorse their unions. 
 the congregation for the doctrine of the faith, the vatican’s doctrinal watchdog, issued the judgment in response to questions raised by some pastors and parishes that sought to be more welcoming and inclusive of gay couples. 
 the issue of inclusiveness came to the fore in recent years after the pope asked bishops to develop projects and proposals “so that those who manifest a homosexual orientation can receive the assistance they need to understand and fully carry out god’s will in their lives.” blessings for same-sex unions had emerged as one possibility, requiring official clarification. 
 the decision did not imply a judgment on people involved nor a form of “unjust discrimination, but rather a reminder of the truth of the liturgical rite” of the sacrament of matrimony, cardinal luis f. ladaria, the prefect of the congregation, said in an explanatory note. cardinal ladaria wrote that pope francis, who has staunchly opposed gay marriage in the church, had given “his assent to the publication.” 
 in the united states, where more than 6 out of 10 catholics support same-sex marriage, according to a 2019 pew survey, many gay catholics and their advocates mourned the announcement, and said it would inevitably lead to more gay people and those who support them leaving the church. 
 “the vatican does what the vatican does, and sometimes the vatican really hurts people whose lives they are unfamiliar with,” said jason steidl, a theologian at st. joseph’s college who is gay. “pastorally, it’s a devastating pronouncement for l.g.b.t.q. people.” 
 francis debernardo, the executive director of new ways ministry who has been an advocate for gay catholics for four decades, noted that “priests in parishes” were already celebrating such blessings. he said that catholics would “continue to find creative ways to bless the couples they love and support,” and that “catholic laity will step in and perform their own rituals, gestures, and words of support.”  
 francis has repeatedly expressed support for gay people. only a few months after his election in 2013, he famously said, “who am i to judge?” when asked during a papal flight from brazil about priests who might be gay. the pope also made headlines in october when he appeared to endorse same-sex civil unions. the vatican later clarified that the pope believed that gay couples deserved civil protections, including legal rights and health care benefits, but that his comments had not marked a change in church doctrine. 
 the catholic church considers homosexual acts “intrinsically disordered.”  
 in 2003, the congregation for the doctrine of the faith ruled that the church’s “respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.” that document, which was signed by cardinal joseph ratzinger, then the prefect of the congregation and who went on to become pope benedict xvi, sought to sway catholic lawmakers as an increasing number of countries were ratifying legal rights for same-sex couples. 
 in the ruling made public on monday, the vatican said that catholic teaching held that marriage between a man and woman was part of god’s plan, and that since gay unions were not intended to be part of that plan, they could not be blessed by the church. 
 in explaining the ruling on monday, the vatican said that relationships involving “sexual activity outside of marriage,” which the vatican described as an “indissoluble union of a man and a woman open in itself to the transmission of life” did not follow the “creator’s plans,” even if those relationships had “positive elements.” the vatican also said that the risk existed that same-sex unions could be misconstrued as constituting “a certain imitation” of the nuptial blessing that is invoked in matrimony, which is a sacrament in the catholic church. in fact, “there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to god’s plan for marriage and family,” the vatican wrote, citing pope francis’ landmark 2016 document on the theme of family, “amoris laetitia,” or “the joy of love.”  
 though few were surprised by the vatican’s decision, critics said the statement’s tone was notably harsh. a line saying that god “does not and cannot bless sin” stood out in its reduction of loving relationships to moral offenses. 
 “that line in particular is going to cause tremendous pain and anger,” said marianne duddy-burke, executive director of dignityusa, a national advocacy group for gay catholics. “the fact that our church still denies people a sense of sacredness about their relationships is deeply painful to those of who hold fast to our faith.”

 two riders had lodged objections against maximum security; the stewards did not post an inquiry. an objection is a claim of foul by a rider, a patrol judge or another racing official. the stewards, who oversee races for the kentucky horse racing commission and for churchill downs, got to work studying replays of the race, with millions of dollars riding on their decision. they analyzed every available angle of the race on screens in a tiny clubhouse office high above the racetrack. 
 this job has existed for ages in america’s oldest sport, essentially making stewards the pioneers of video review. charged with protecting bettors, they stay out of sight and rarely speak to the news media, so it was an odd sight on saturday when the stewards — barbara borden, chief steward of the kentucky horse racing commission; brooks a. becraft, a state steward; and tyler picklesimer, a track steward — were on the podium usually reserved for the winners of america’s biggest horse race. 
 borden read a statement explaining the decision. she declined to take any questions. (the kentucky horse racing commission is a state government agency charged with regulating the conduct of horse racing and parimutuel wagering on horse racing and related activities.) 
 she explained that the riders of no. 18, long range toddy, and no. 20, country house, had lodged complaints against maximum security, saying there had been interference as they left the quarter-pole and headed for home.  
 “we had a lengthy review of the race,” borden said. “we interviewed affected riders.” she said the stewards had unanimously agreed that maximum security drifted out and affected the progress of no. 1, war of will, in turn interfering with long range toddy and no. 21, bodexpress. 
 why stewards at churchill downs unanimously agreed to disqualify the would-be winner, maximum security, for interfering with other horses around the final turn of saturday’s kentucky derby: 
 the foul occurred as the horses approached the final turn on the rain-soaked track. 
 maximum security jumped a puddle and drifted outside his lane, obstructing war of will, long range toddy and bodexpress. 
 the jockey tyler gaffalione said he had to wrangle the reins just to stay aboard war of will. two other riders lodged complaints against maximum security.

 “those horses were all affected, we thought, by the interference,” she said. “therefore, we unanimously determined to disqualify no. 7 and place him behind the 18, the 18 being the lowest-placed horse that he bothered, which is our typical procedure.” that made maximum security the 17th-place finisher officially. 
 country house became the first horse to win the derby on an objection; dancer’s image was disqualified in 1968 after a post-race urinalysis found traces of a banned substance, and forward pass was declared the winner. 
 “if it were a maiden claiming race on a weekday, the winner would come down,” country house’s trainer, bill mott, told nbc as he anxiously awaited the stewards’ decision with the 150,729 in attendance and the countless others watching at home. 
 once in the winner’s circle, a smiling if a bit stunned mott, a hall of famer, acknowledged it was an odd way to capture his first derby win.

16.0,0.0031817521328399213,0.2689999938011169,"animal, dog, human, cat, specie, pet, wild, wildlife, park, fish","every morning, rain, shine or snow, people stand around making conversation with strangers as their dogs chase, run and mingle. ranging from elaborate fenced playgrounds and rolling fields to small inner-city runs, dog parks are among the fastest growing park amenities nationwide. the trust for public land found that there has been a 40 percent increase in the development of dog parks since 2009. 
 the first dog park in the united states was the ohlone dog park, which was founded by martha scott benedict and doris richards in 1979 in berkeley, calif. since then, dog parks have become standard amenities in developing city and suburban neighborhoods across the country, but are they actually good for dogs? surprisingly, canine behavior experts aren’t so sure. 
 according to a 2018 survey conducted by the national recreation and park association (n.r.p.a.), 91 percent of americans believe dog parks provide benefits to their communities. this was especially true among millennials and gen xers, who overwhelmingly recognized dog parks as beneficial amenities. the study found that the top two reasons responders cited for supporting dog parks were that 60 percent thought that they gave dogs a safe space to exercise and roam freely, and 48 percent felt that dog parks were important because they allowed dogs to socialize. 
 especially for urban dogs that don’t have backyards to exercise in, dog parks can sound like a great idea. there is nothing natural, however, about dogs that aren’t familiar with one another to be put in large groups and expected to play together. many of us just accept the assumption that dog parks are good places to socialize a dog, but that may not be the case. 
 nick hof, a certified professional dog trainer and chair of the association of professional dog trainers, explained that in terms of canine behavior, the term “socialization” isn’t just dogs interacting or “socializing” with other dogs, but rather, “the process of exposing young puppies under 20 weeks to new experiences.” 
 “this helps them have more confidence and adapt to new situations,” mr. hof said. 
 though socialization is critical for the healthy development of puppies, the dog park is not where you want to bring your puppy to learn about appropriate interactions with other dogs, mr. hof added. 
 “dog parks are not a safe place to socialize a puppy under 6-12 months old,” he continued. “during our puppy’s early months, they are more sensitive to experiences, so a rambunctious greeter at the park may be enough to cause our puppy to be uncertain of all dogs,” mr. hof explained. 
 the goal for socializing young puppies is to ensure they have only positive interactions, and to avoid any overwhelming or frightening interactions. instead of taking puppies to a dog park for socialization, mr. hof encourages owners to attend puppy classes with their dog to meet age-appropriate playmates. 
 socialization with older dogs is a bit more challenging, because in a behavioral sense, older dogs have already had all of their formative socialization experiences. dog guardians generally mean well when they bring a shy dog to the dog park with the intention of giving that dog positive interactions with other dogs. unfortunately, this can backfire; a dog who is nervous or uncomfortable is more likely to be easily overwhelmed in a park setting, which can lead to dog fights or a long-term fear of encountering other dogs. a park setting also allows dogs to pick up bad habits from one another, and is definitely not a place you want to bring a dog who is under-socialized. 
 although dogs are social animals and regularly engage in various forms of play, the artificial setup of a dog park can be challenging. many people bring their dogs to the park to burn off excess energy, but these dogs often display over-aroused and rude behavior that can trigger issues between dogs. dr. heather b. loenser, senior veterinary officer of the american animal hospital association cautioned that “unfortunately, just because an owner thinks their dog plays well with others, doesn’t mean they always do.” 
 having your dog in a dog park requires trusting that everyone in the park is monitoring their dog, and is a good judge about whether their dog should be in the park in the first place. that’s a lot of trust to put in a stranger. 
 unlike doggy day cares or play groups, most dog parks are public spaces that are not screened or supervised by canine professionals. 
 this can be an issue with fights between dogs that can lead to dogs learning inappropriate behaviors from other dogs. “bad experiences can also ripple outward and cause our dogs to have issues or concerns outside of the dog park as well,” mr. hof said, adding that dogs at dog parks might pick up bad habits such as being pushy when greeting or engaging in play with other dogs. on other hand, dogs that are overwhelmed by the boisterousness of others may become withdrawn, skittish and nervous when meeting other dogs in and out of the dog park. 
 one of the biggest dangers of dog parks is that they often don’t have separate play enclosures for large and small dogs, or when they do, owners can choose to disregard those spaces. even without meaning to, a large dog can easily cause serious injury or even kill a smaller dog. 
 from minor scuffles to serious incidents, injuries are common at dog parks. bite wounds are common, even from rough play. even if the wound seems small, “seek veterinary care immediately,” dr. loenser advised. 
 bites that occur in fights or during play often involve tearing under the skin, which can be complicated to heal, and may carry a greater risk of infection. muscle strains and sprains from lunging and rough play are also common. “anytime dogs quickly pivot on their back legs, they are also at risk for tearing the ligaments, specifically the cranial cruciate ligament in their knees,” dr. loenser said. these types of knee-and-ligament injuries often require expensive surgery and extensive healing and rehabilitation. 
 even clean and well maintained dog parks can pose health risks, in particular the spread of easily communicable diseases. one challenge of dog parks being unregulated public spaces is that while most post signs saying dogs should be vaccinated, no proof of vaccinations is actually required. 
 the american animal hospital association advises owners who bring their pets to the park to have them vaccinated with the bordetella vaccine, which prevents “kennel cough,” as well as distemper. you’ll also want to have your dog vaccinated against leptospirosis, as communal water bowls, puddles and other water features in dog parks can carry leptospira bacteria. all dogs should be vaccinated against rabies, and dogs that visit dog parks should be on flea and tick prevention as well as year-round heartworm prevention. dogs that visit dog parks should also be vaccinated against canine influenza (dog flu) that can be transmitted through the air. 
 dr. loenser cautioned that although “currently, the influenza vaccines available cover for the strains that are most commonly seen, if new strains are introduced or mutate, these vaccines might not provide cross-protection.” if that were to occur, dogs that visited dog parks and had contact with a large number of dogs that might or might not be fully vaccinated would be at risk of getting sick. 
 most dog owners aren’t skilled at reading their dog’s body language beyond a wagging tail, so warning signs that your dog is uncomfortable, unhappy or angry are often ignored. this leads to minor and major dog fights. understanding canine body language is key to supporting your dog’s comfort and safety, and assessing if a playgroup at the dog park is going to be a good match. 
 “the dog park is not a place for you to let your dog run unsupervised while you socialize with other people,” mr. hof said. “keep an eye on your dog and make sure that they are both being good and having a good time.” this means watching the actions and behaviors of your dog and the other dogs in the park. if things are getting too intense, that’s a good time to leave. 
 but what exactly should you be watching for? dr. loenser says that subtle signs of fear or aggression include “lip licking, yawning or panting when not hot.” other signs of discomfort or a brewing issue include stiff bodies and erect tails. keeping an eye out for these signs can give you the edge to intervene on your dog’s behalf before an interaction with another dog escalates. 
 even dogs that appear to be playing well together may be at risk. “healthy play between dogs should include small breaks or pauses,” mr. hof said. “if you are uncertain about if all dogs are happy, i recommend stopping the dog who may be too over-the-top and seeing what the other dog does. if the other dog tries to re-engage, it’s a good indicator that everything was okay. if the other dog runs off though, a break was a good idea.” 
 any kind of behavior that involve one dog pinning another dog is also one to avoid. barking, growling and other vocalization occasionally during play is normal, but frenzied barking is generally too much. 
 on a good day, if the dog park you visit is large enough, it may physically tire out your dog. but the visit won’t actually provide your dog with the kind of enriching mental and emotional stimulation that dogs need. dog parks, unfortunately, are often more about humans than they are about dogs. 
 as much as humans enjoy the chance to socialize with other like-minded animal lovers while our dogs play, it’s far safer and more fun for your dog to skip the dog park and spend that time engaging intentionally with you and their surroundings by going on walks, taking a training or general obedience class or even trying a new sport together. ultimately you’re the only one who can determine if the risks outweigh the benefits of dog parks, but there is no shame in not surrendering your dog to what has become the quintessential urban dog experience: running with dozens of strangers in a small, smelly pen as people stand by, looking at their phones or gossiping. make the time you have with your dog meaningful and enriching; after all, your dog wants to spend time with you, too.

 one morning she was sipping her favorite gatorade (the yellow one), and two hours later the drink was completely flavorless. she immediately lit a candle and blew it out, but she couldn’t smell the smoke. 
 her sense of smell had disappeared. now, she said, “everything either tastes like bleach or tastes like nothing.” 
 over the past few months she has lost 19 pounds. “i don’t have that ‘i’m hungry’ feeling,” said ms. drager, 41, who lives in sevierville, tenn., about 45 minutes from knoxville. “i think you forget how much smell and taste is a part of your life until it goes away.” 
 as the coronavirus continues to spread, there are increasing numbers of people who have either lost their senses of smell after contracting covid or are struggling with parosmia, a disturbing disorder that causes previously normal odors to develop a new, often unpleasant aroma. 
 one meta-analysis published in september found that as many as 77 percent of those who had covid were estimated to have some form of smell loss as a result of their infections. 
 the recommended treatment for these conditions is smell training. but how exactly do you do it, and why should you bother? 
 we spoke with several experts to demystify the process. 
 first, let’s talk about what smell training is not. if the words conjure up images of a “rocky” training montage — as they did for tejal rao, a new york times restaurant critic who lost her sense of smell after contracting covid last year — the reality is very different. smell training is more akin to physical therapy for your nose: tedious and repetitive. it involves sniffing several potent scents twice a day, sometimes for months, to stimulate and restore the olfactory system — or at the very least to help it function better. 
 “it’s not a quick fix,” said chrissi kelly, a member of the global consortium for chemosensory research and the founder of abscent, a nonprofit based in england and wales that offers support and education to people around the world who have smell disorders. “you have to keep up with it.” 
 if it has been a couple of weeks since you lost your sense of smell and it hasn’t started to come back, then it makes sense to start smell training. when your smell starts to come back, it might happen gradually rather than all at once. at first, scents might seem distorted or foul. 
 scientists are still learning about all of the mechanisms by which the coronavirus affects the olfactory system, but they believe parosmia occurs because the neural pathways from the nose to the brain have been disrupted, “kind of like a telephone operator from the 1950s connecting the wrong party to another line,” said pamela dalton, a faculty member at the monell chemical senses center, a nonprofit research institute in philadelphia. 
 for most people, parosmia is a symptom of recovery, and that’s why experts believe smell training can be beneficial as you continue to heal. 
 even if you’re devastated over having lost your sense of smell, you might be thinking: do i really need to add smell training to my to-do list? won’t my sense of smell return eventually all by itself? 
 for many people, it appears to come back within weeks of being infected. 
 a study published in january that recruited patients from 18 european hospitals found that among 1,363 coronavirus patients with olfactory dysfunction, most recovered their senses of smell within two months and 40 percent saw their ability to smell return within two weeks. all patients were encouraged to follow two daily sessions of smell training at home, said dr. jerome r. lechien, a professor of otolaryngology at the university hospital of brussels and one of the authors of the study. though it’s unclear how many patients did the training, nearly one-quarter were still experiencing smell dysfunction 60 days after the onset of their symptoms. by the six-month mark, 95 percent of the patients had recovered their senses of smell. 
 robust studies examining the efficacy of olfactory training among covid survivors have not yet been published. several studies, however, have demonstrated that smell training can help people who have lost some or all of their senses of smell to other viral illnesses like sinus infections — that’s why it is widely considered the best option for those who can no longer smell properly after contracting covid. 
 “it has no risk — except boredom,” dr. dalton said wryly. 
 before you begin, however, it is wise to rule out other conditions that could be affecting your sense of smell. 
 “i saw somebody recently who had smell dysfunction following covid-19, and it turned out they had inflammatory nasal polyps,” said dr. sunthosh k. sivam, an ear, nose and throat specialist and an assistant professor at the baylor college of medicine in houston. once he removed the polyps, which were unrelated to covid, his patient’s sense of smell improved greatly. 
 “seeing an e.n.t. is a good way to make sure nothing else is missed,” he added. 
 to start, decide on four scents that are familiar to you and that evoke strong memories, the experts said. these are the fragrances that you will stick with throughout the initial phase of your training. maybe one of them is a scented shampoo, a favorite cologne or lemons from the tree in your backyard. an avid home cook, for example, might use certain spices from his pantry. 
 alternatively, “some people have had a lot of success with things that smell bad,” dr. dalton said. 
 at one point during her smell training, ms. rao, the restaurant critic, used spoiled milk. ms. drager, who had covid-19 over the summer, extinguishes a candle every day and tries to smell the smoke. 
 if that doesn’t sound appealing, you can choose to buy a smell kit that contains essential oils: the classic scents are rose, eucalyptus, clove and lemon. the kits usually retail for under $50. 
 or you can purchase these oils yourself at a place like whole foods. ms. kelly includes instructions on how to make your own scent kit on the abscent website. 
 if you buy your own oils and you want to smell them directly from the open container, first ask someone who isn’t smell impaired to try it. then ask whether the person can easily smell the fragrance when the scent is a few inches below his or her nose. (some containers have such small openings that it might be difficult to get a good whiff.) in the process, avoid getting any of the oils on your skin because they are highly concentrated. 
 there is not one uniform, universal way of undergoing smell training, but the experts we spoke with offered similar advice. 
 they recommend keeping your scents in an easily accessible location — such as by your bedside — and smelling each scent for about 20 seconds so that the entire smell-training session lasts approximately one minute. 
 while you’re doing this, take short sniffs rather than deep inhales, recommended ms. kelly of abscent as she demonstrated a series of repetitive whiffs that she referred to as “bunny sniffs.” 
 while you’re smelling the fragrances, it often helps to look at a picture of the thing that you’re smelling, said dr. nicholas r. rowan, an assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore. 
 then, try to imagine what the item used to smell or taste like to you. 
 “it’s not simply the act of smelling something, but it’s also this sort of mindful imagining of what that smelled like when you were eating it or when you put it on your skin — if it was a lotion, for example,” dr. dalton said. “it just makes it more enjoyable to continue with the process.” 
 smelling something that is connected to a memory or emotion is ideal, she said, because the brain plays such a big role in how we perceive smell. 
 generally, doctors advise their patients to do smell training twice a day for three months. 
 “keep on training for a year if you have to,” said dr. thomas hummel, a researcher at the smell and taste clinic of the otorhinolaryngology department at the technical university of dresden in germany, whose work has informed the odor training methods now used around the world. 
 the success of your training depends on a variety of factors, including your age. in general, younger people recover their sense of smell after a viral illness at a higher rate than older people, dr. hummel added. this is partly because older people tend to have fewer olfactory receptor neurons — the cells that detect and transmit information about smells to the central nervous system — and their receptor neurons do not regenerate as quickly. 
 “when you’re older, everything is slower,” he said. 
 as with any process that doesn’t yield immediate results, you may find it difficult to stick with the plan. 
 “it’s very frustrating for patients,” dr. rowan said. “they seek out this care because they can’t smell and want it fixed and then we say, ‘hey, use this sensory function that you don’t have.’” but, he added, “this is the best thing out there.” 
 he suggested using a calendar to record each scent training session in order to build the habit. 
 keeping a diary can also be helpful, ms. kelly said, so that you can take notes on what you’re experiencing during each session. for further motivation, the abscent website offers an app called snif that can help you track your progress. 
 finally, if you don’t know many people who have a smell dysfunction, consider joining an online community for support and inspiration. the abscent facebook group for people with covid has grown to more than 25,000 people, ms. kelly said. 
 as for ms. drager, although she is still working to heal her olfactory system, she did smell a lemon scent this year for the first time since her sense of smell disappeared. 
 she cried with relief. 
 “i’m making slow progress,” she said.",11331
